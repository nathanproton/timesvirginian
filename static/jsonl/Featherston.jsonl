Ear lier Mr John Fisher held forth for a number of years. Mr. Crawley had taught at Frederick Jollege, Mary land and also taught at Martins ville. There were six teachers at the local school in 1909. They got about the same salnries the teachers re ceive now, anw the local school al ways had a full nine-month term. The dormitory began its service in 1914. It cost 11,000. Pupils were boarded in a number of residences around town, and came here from nearby counties. Profes sor Crawley was the agriculture teacher for several years, as well as principal. Mrs. May Walton Green taught home economics. How many recall Miss Alene Houser? Stables were located near where the present home economics is lo cated. Professor Crawley says he helped get up the stumps where the present playground is! The auditorium went up in 1922. Mr. Featherston was superintendent then. We neglected to state that pro fessor Crawley also taught in Geor gia before coming here. The school board once leased him for a resi dence a dwelling next to the present Lee Theatre. Then, he lived in the dormitory five years. He has had many tempting offers to leave Appo mattox, but local folks wouldnt let him go. He says he knows of only one other principal who has matched his service tenure, that one being at Lexington. _We hope he is good for another thirty years!

The County at that time had no money for poor pupils, in 1847, Barbara G. Wright petitioned the Legislature for pay . for educating poor pupils. She had conducted a School in that part of Prince Edward County which was cut off to Appomat tox County. Ten years later, in 1857, one William A. Swann petitioned the Legislature to pay him for pupils taught by him. He con ducted a School in Prince Edward County, but had some pupil from Appomattox. He asked for four cents per day per pupil, his bill amounting to 17.36. Two to four cents per day per pupil was the regular rate in free schools of that day. Pri vate schools were numerous, so good and so cheap, that only the poorest children attended free schools. A teacher in free schools in those days made from 25.00 to 50.00 a year, but needed to know nothing more than the three Rs and not much of them. The first public school in the county was lo cated near the site of the Old Court House. It opened in 1870, with J. H. Featherston as teacher, and our School System has gradually developed through the years, from the one room school until now we have three Senior High Schools, with Home Economics, Agricultural and Manual Treaining Departments, two for white and one for colored, and a number of graded elementry schools throughout the County, with a great ma jority of the students being transported to and from school by busses.

L. Ferguson and Dele gate Albert Terrell in the Gener al Assembly were commended at a mass meeting of democratic voters last Friday. Don Moses, chairman of the county democratic committee called the meeting to order anc Senator Ferguson was elected chairman of the meeting while C. W. Spnith was chosen as its secretary. A resolution proposed by Mr. Smith and unanimously adopted provided that 64 delegates with a fourth vote vote each be sent to Roanoke that the chairman of the meeting appoint a com mittee of three, one from each magisterial district, to nominate these delegates that the dele gates from the county vote as a unit at the convention easting their ballots as a majority of them might determine and that those present at the convention cast the entire vote of the dele gation. Joel Flood introduced a reso lution expressing appreciation of the able representation given the county in the house of delegates by Colonel Terrell and commend ing him particularly for his ad vocacy of a change in the  nieth- od of gasolene tax distribution which would be more fair to the poorer counties in the state than the method now in use. J. R. Horsley introduced a resolution in which he praised Senator Ferguson for his activi ties representing the county in the state senate and both of these resolutions were unanimously adopted. , Senator Ferguson introduced following resolutions Whereas, the voters of Ap pomattox county are happy to have with us to-day, Governor Byrd, who will explain to the voters of. our county, the consti tutional amendments, to be voted on at the special election, to be held on June 19. Now, Therefore, Be It Re solved That we commend the fair and forceful campaign our governor is making, for which too much praise and commenda tion cannot be given. His high character and ability has reflected itself in his splendid administra tion. In a word, he has proven himself to be a great Virginian, and a matchless leader. Be it further resolved That we are in thorough accord with the far-sighted, broad-minded progessive and economic policies which he has advocated, and which have been written into the law of our state, which now stands in the front rank of the Union. Delegates to the Roanoke con vention were chosen from the various precincts as follows and the report of the nominating committee was adopted without a dissenting vote Courthouse S. L. Ferguson, R.L.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.
