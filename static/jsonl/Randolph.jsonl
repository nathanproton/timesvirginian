Hampton Moore, of Philadel phia, as its president, and the selec tion of New London, Conn., as the meeting place for its convention next September, the Atlantic Deeper W aterways Association finished the business sessions oLlts fourth annual convention here Thursday. A resolution was adopted appoint ing a committee of ten members to urge upon President T aft and Con gress the enactm ent of legislation carrying into effect the recommen dations of the boards of engineers of the United States Army, for the ex tension and improvement of the intra- costal waterways system. Addresses to the convention were made by M. K. King, of Virginia Congressman John H. Small, of North Carolina Isham Randolph, ftf the Chicago Sanitary Commission Logan W. Page, director of public roads, and E. Dana Durand, director of the cen sus. An annual saving of approximately 400,000,000 by improvement oL the main roads in the United States so as to cut the cost of hauling in half , was advdeated by Logan W aller Page, di rector of the office of public roads in the Federal Department of Agricul ture. Mr. Page said that 20 per cent, of the highways carry 90 per cent of the traffic and that 440,000 miles should be improved to accommodate present highway needs. If th e principal highways were al ways passable for heavy-loaded ve hicles, he said, there would not be such, great variations in- rates and freight congestion, railroad and water way equipment could be employed to better advantage, freight handled more cheaply and the farm er enabled, to take advantage of m arket prices. Mr. Page said that many farthing communities import more agricultural products than they export, owing to bad highways. The address of E. Dana Durand, di rector of tbe census, turned on the dominant position maintained by the thirteen original States. Although their territory comprises only one-eighth of the United States area, he said, they contain two-fifths of the population and produce 53 per cent, of the total value of manufac tured products, 46 per cent, of the mineral products and 61 per cent, of the coal. Their exports are 58 per cent, of the countrys total and their imports are 79 per cent. Their railroad mileage is 23 per cent, of the total qf the country and th e ir- proportion of railroad freight and passenger traffic is much larger.

An officer of a Confederate regi ment during the closing days of the war, called on the late Col. K.

An Historic List. The wedding of Miss Wilson and M t . Sayre, will be the last up to date of a long list of historic weddings which have since 1811 taken place in the White House. The first was that ot Lucy Payne Washington, sister of Mrs. James Madison, the wife of the then President Madison, who was married to D. Judge1 Todd, of Ken tucky. The others who have pledged their troth in the famous old mansion are In 1812, Anna Todd, cousin of Mrs. Madison, who married Representative John G. Jackson, of Virginia. In 1826, John Adams, son of Presi dent Adams, married his cousin, Helen Jackson. . From 1829 to 1837, during the Jack- son administration, there were three weddings. Della Lewis, a friend of President Jacksons, was married to Alphonse Joseph Yver Pageot, an at tache of the French Legation. Mary Easton, niece of President Jackson, was married to Ludem B. Polk, and Emily Martin, a connection of the Jackson family, was married to Lewis Randolph. In 1878, Emily Pratt, niece of Presi dent Hayes, and Gen. Russell Hastings were married. In 1886, President Cleveland and Frances Folsom were married. The daughters of Presidents who have married from the White House were Maria Monroe, who married her cousin, Samuel Gouveneur Elizabeth Tyler, who married William Waller NeWe Grant, who married Algernon Sartoris, and Alice Roosevelt, who married Nicholas Longsworth.
