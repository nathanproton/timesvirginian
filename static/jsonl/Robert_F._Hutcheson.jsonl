These men de- I nied the charges. Governor John Garland Pol lard is proud enough of his Virginia ancestry not to care whether he has any Massachu setts ancestry or not. Mayor Curley, of Boston recently in vited him to attend the tercent- ary celebration next month in the Massachusetts capital, and said he was trying to trace a 1 relationship between Governor Pollard and the Pollards of the Bay State.

The magazine states that the chambers agricultural i and traffic departments have been deluged with inquiries from farmers and dealers concern ing their inability to obtain the rate reduction announced in dispatches from Washington. Robert B. Vial,. 20-year-old Hanover County farmer, is be ing held in Henrico jail on a charge of murdering Laney Jones, wealthy recluse, on the Jones plantation, Hilly Farm in Hanover County., Vial is said by the authorities to have confessed to the killing of Jones, following an argument over repairs to a farm motor truck.

The charge was made in a letter to Governor Pollard, who made the letter public without comment. Farmers, fruit growers and stockmen of Loudoun County, one of the richest agricultural counties in the State, are esti mated to have lost 3,000,000 as a result of the drought, ac cording to County Agent, J.
