Francisco evaded his pursuers by turning down an obscure road, and got away with his booty. He sold the horses at Prince Ed ward Courthouse, except one, which he kept for many years and named Tarleton. When the war was over, Francisco settled lown to peaceful pursuits. Thre was nothing of the bully about him. On the contrary, he was so good-natured that it was not easy to provoke him to a quar rel. In the year 1806 Fran cisco was keeping a tavern in Amelia county. A man rode up to the gate, and Francisco went out to welcome the guest. The man inquired whether he was Peter Francisco. On learning he was, he said that he had come all the way from Kentucky to whip him. Peter called to a boy and sent him to bring a bunch of willows. When they were brought, he handed them to the man, say ing, Now lash me over the shoulders, and you can go home and tell that you have done your errand. The man finding him hard to provoke, dismounted and requested to feel his weight. He lifted Francisco twice and remarked that he was quite heavy. Ahen Francisco requested to lift him He picked him up and easily threw him over the fence. The man was somewhat hurt by the fall, but picked himself up an dsaid, Now, if you will throw my horse over, I will thank you,Francisco immedi ately complied with his re quest, throwing the horse over the fence without any difficul ty. The man mounted his horse and rode away perfectly satisfied witth his experience. This tale was told to Henry Clay when he visited Francisco in 1826 and greatly amused him. Mr. Clay laughingly re marked that he was glad one of the mischievous Pamphlet family had come to gnf This was a playful allusion to the political pamphlets written against him. Many anecdotes are related of him, illustrating his good nature and his kindness to his poorer neighbors, which I have not space to recount. Francisco was thrice mar ried. His second wife only left children. They were two sons and two daughters. All of them married into good families and their numerous decendants may be counted among the best citizens of the Old Dominion. Peter Francisco died in 1882 and was buried on Shockoe Hill, in Richmond, not very far from the spot on which he first landed in the State. One of the districts of Buckingham county is named after him and his portrait was hung in the courthouse.

He then mounted one of the horses and drove the others before him.- Tartelon soon came up and sent a party to capture him, offering a reward for his head. Francisco evaded his pursuers by turning down an obscure road, and got away with hjB booty. He sold the horses at Prince Ed ward Courthouse, except one which he kept for many years and named Tarletori. When the war was over Francisco settled lown to peaceful pursuits. Thye was nothing of the bully about him On the contrary, he was so good-natured that it was not easy to provoke him to a quar rel. In the year 1806 Fran cisco was keeping a tavern in Amelia county. A man rode up to the gate, and Francisco went out to welcome the guest. The man inquired whether he was Peter Francisco. . On learning he was, he said that he had come all the way from Kentucky to whip him. Peter called to a boy and sent him to bring a bunch of willows. When they, were brought, he handed them to the man, say ing, Now lash me over the shoulders, and you can go home and tell that you have done your errand. The man finding him hard -to provoke, dismounted and requested to feel his weight. He lifted Francisco twice and remarked that he was quite heavy. Ahen Francisco requested to lift him He picked him up and easily threw him over the fence. The man was somewhat hurt by the fall, but picked himself up an dsaid, Now, if you will throw my horse over, I will thank you,Francisco immedi ately complied with his re quest, throwing the horse over the fence without any difficul ty. The man mounted his horse and rode away perfectly satisfied witth his experience. This tale was told to Henry Clay when he visited Francisco in 1826 and greatly amused him. Mr. Clay laughingly re marked that he was glad one of the mischievous Pamphlet family had come to grief. This was a playlful allusion to the political pamphlets . written against him. Many anecdotes, are relatec of him, illustrating his gooc nature and his kindness to his poorer neighbors, which I have not space to recount. Francisco was thrice mar ried. His second wife only left children. They were two sons and two daughters. A1 of them, married into gooc families and their numerous deceridants may be countec among the best citizens of the Old Dominion. Peter Francisco died in 1882 and was buried ori Shockoe Hill, in Richmond, not very far from the spot on which he first landed in the State. One of the districts of Buckingham county is named after him and his portrait was hung in the courthouse. I regret to add that the portrait together with the courthouse was destroyer by fire a few years ago."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Peter", "Francisco"], "snippet": "inquired whether he was <mark>Peter</mark> <mark>Francisco</mark>. .

C.In this discourse Dr. Talmage urges thoughtfulness for oth ers, and shows how such a benignant spirit may be fostered text, I Peter ii, 8, Be courteous. In an age when bluntness has been ca nonized as a virtue it may be useful to ex tol one of the most beautiful of all the royal family of gracescourtesy. It is graciousness, deference to the wishes of others, good manners, affability, willing ness to deny ourselves somewhat for the advantage of others, urbanity. But what is the use of my defining the grace of cour tesy when we all know so well what it ia? The botanist might say aome very inter- eating things about a rose, and the chem ist might discourse about water or light, but without ever seeing a botanist or a chemist we know what a rose is and what water and light are. Do not take our time in telling us what courtesy is. Only show us how we may get more of it and avoid what are its counterfeits. Mark you, it cannot be put on or dramatized suces fully for a long while. We may. ba ful oJ hows and genuflections, and smiles an? complimentary phrase, and have nothing of genuine courtesy either in our make-up or m our demeanor. A backswoodsman who never saw a drawing room or a danc ing master or a caterer or a fold of drap ery may with his big soul and hard hand and awkward salutation exercise the grace, while one bora under richest upholstery and educated in foreign schools, and both ered to know which of ten garments he will take from a royal wardrobe, may he as barren of the spirit of courtesy as the great Sahara desert is of green meadows and tossing fountains. - Christian courtesy is born in the heart by the power of the Holy Ghost, who has transformed and illumined and glorified ones nature. Mark you, I am speaking of the highest kind of courtesy, which is Christian courtesy. Something like itor dinary politenessmay grow up with us under the direction of intelligent and watchful parentage, but I am not speaking of that which is merely agreeableness of conversation and behavior. All that may be a matter of tutelage and fine surround ing and show itself in lifting the hat to passers-by and in a graceful way of asking about your health and sending the right kind of acceptance when you cannot go and understanding all the laws of prefer ence at table and parlor door, all of which is well. I am speaking of a principle of courtesy so imdanted in ones nature that his suavity of conversation And manner shall be the outburst of what he feels for the happiness aad welfare of others, a principle that will work in the next world as well as in this, and will he as appro priate in the mansions of heaven as in earthly dwelling places. Now, you know as well as I do that some of the most undesirable people have been seeming incarnations of courtesy. In our early American history there arose a man of wonderful talent, an impersonation of all that can charm drawing rooms and cultivated circles. Aged men who knew him in their youth have told me that he was the most irresistible man they ever met, his voice silvery, his smile bewitch ing, his glove immaculate, his eye piercing, his high forehead wreathed in curls, lus attire a fascination. He became Vice-Pres ident of the United States and within one vote of being President. Men threw away their fortunes to help him in his political aspirations and to forward him in a con spiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States, he trying to do in America what Napoleon at that very time was trying to do in Europeestablish a throne for himself. But he was immoral and corrupt. He was the serpent that wound its way into many a domestic par adise. He shot to death one of the great est of Americans  Alexander Hamilton. The world found out long ago before he left it that the offender I speak of was an embodiment of dissoluteness and base am bition. He was the best illustration that I know of the fact that a man may have the appearance of courtesy while within he is all wrong. Absalom, a Bible character, was a speci men of a man of polish outside and of rot- tenness inside. Beautiful, brilliant and with such wealth of hair that when it was cut in each December as a matter of pride he had it weighed, and it weighed 200 shekels. He captured all who came near him. But, oh, what a heart he hadfull of treachery and unfilial spirit and base ness! He was as bad as ne was alluring and charming. . ,. In the famous Athenian Alcibiades his tory discourses of the same splendor of manner covering utter depravity. Noble pedigree, transcendent abilities, radiant personality, eloquent tongue, triumphant warrior, victor at Olympic games, hut a debauchee and an impersonation of all the vices. Alas, that all up and down history and clear on into our day there are so many of what Christ called  wolves in sheeps clothing   whitewashed sepul chers, full of dead mens bond and all un- cleanness! Gilded abominations, walk ing lazerettos, attired in Vermillion and goTd. Perdition hanging out the banners of heaven. As far as possible are they re moved from all genuine courtesy. I like what John Wesley said to a man when their carriages met on the road, The ruffian, knowing Mr. Wesley and dis liking him, did not turn out, but kept the middle of the road. Mr. Wesley cheerfully gave the man all the road, himself riding into the ditch. As they passed each other the ruffian said,  I never turn out for fools, and Mr. Wesley said,  I always do. I like the reproof which a Chinaman in San Francisco gave an American. The American pushed him off the sidewalk untii he fell into the mud. The Chinaman on rising began to brush off the mud and said to the American You Christian me ! heathen. Good-bye. A stranger entered ! a church in one of the cities and was al-  lowed to stand a long while, although thers was plenty of room. No one offered a seat. The stranger after awhile said to one of the brethren, What church is this? The answer was.  Christs church, sir. Is He in? said the stranger. The officer of the church understood what was meant and gave him a seat. We want more cour tesy in places of business, more courtesy in our homes. But heart courtesy must precede hand and head and foot courtesy. Cultivation of it should begin in the fathers house. You often notice that brothers and sisters are often gruff and snappy and say things and do things that they would not hare the outside world know about. Rough things are sometimes said in households which ought never to be said at allteasing and recrimination and fault-finding and harsh criticisms, which will have their echo thirty and forty and fifty years afterward. In the sleet driven by the east wind no sweet flowers of kindness and geniality will grow. Let children hear their parents picking at each other, and those children will be found picking at each other, and far down the road of life will be seen the same dis position to nick at others. Better than this habit of picking at children, which so many parents indulge in, would be one good, healthy application of the rod. Bet ter a shower that lasts a few minutes than the cold drizzle of many days. We never S et over our first home, however many ouses we may have afterward. Uet us all cultivate the grace of Chris tian courtesy by indulging in the habit of praise instead of the habit of blame. There are evils in the world that we must de nounce, and there are men and women who oughc to be chastised, hut never let us allow the opportunity of applauding good deeds pass unimproved. There are two sides to every mans char actera good side and an evil side. The good see only the good and the evil only the evil, and the probability is that a me dium opinion is the right. opinion. Most of the people whom I know are doing about as well as thev can under the cir cumstances. When f see people who are worse than I am, I conclude tnat if I had the same bad influences around me all my life that they have had I would probably have been worse than they now are. The work of reform is the most important work, but many of the reformers, dwell ing on one evil, see nothing but evil, and Ihev set so used to anathema thev forznt"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Peter"], "snippet": "be fostered text, I <mark>Peter</mark> ii, 8, Be courteous."}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Peter"], "snippet": "be fostered text, I <mark>Peter</mark> ii, 8, Be courteous."}], "text_match": 1155199671761633401, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1112386306048", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1155199671761633401", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

It is said that he was a Norweigian  by birth and was brought aver to this country as a slave, by one Jonathan Dumfries. Probably mistaken in this. He stayed with Dumfries until he was 16 years old, and located with Mr. LeGrand, the grandfather of Mr. L. D. Jones, for  short time, until the continental army under General Gates, going south after the sur render of Burgoyne, passed by, and he joined in his shirtsleeves and barefooted. He distinguished him- sfclf by his prowess and gallantry, especially at the Battle of Cow- pens, where he charged through a whole regiment of British cavalry on his splendid horse, cutting down a wide swathe of them with his big broadsword. He also, while scouting alone, took prisoners six British soldiers at one time, and marched them into the American camp. He was a messmate and particular friend of the late Mr. A. Forbes, Sr., and many were the tales he used to tell of Peter the Great as the boys duhibed him. One of these was that he and Peter, while foraging once in South Carolina, came to a springhouse, which was in those days a log structure over the branch close to the spring, with door, lock, and key, for the reception of fresh meat, butter, milk, pies, etc. There being no other way of gaining ad mittance except by breaking the lock, whiah was a capital offense in those days, Peter raised up the corner of the house, and through the hole Forbes entered, and hand ed out the provisions. After satisfy-  ing his appetite, Peter let down the corner, leaving Fonbes to his fate, which was a good cudgeling over the head with a broomstick by Madam Shackelford, the lady and proprietress of the fanm. After the war Peter settled for some years at the New Store, keep ing a tavern, a small store, etc. Then he moved to a farm 2 1-2 miles froim New Store, on Willis River  the farm on which Capt. Sam Jones now resides. The- farm joins the Wood-  lawn farm, now owned by the Chap-  pels, formerly by my great uncle, Captain Samuel Branch .......... Mr. Francisco was a frequent visitor at my uncles, and many were the stories told by cousins of his love of fun and delight in showing his great strength. One of them was that a groat bully from a distance probably from Powhatan once came to fight him. He arrived in the neighborhood about dusk, spent the night with one of Mr. Franciscos neighbors and next morning sallied forth in search of his opponent. He had to go -through a lane with a ten-rail fence on each side, as he approached Mr. Franscisos prom ises, Peter met him at the yard gate, and, as he was dismounting from his horse caught him by the seat of his breeches with one hand, and threw him over the fence. The man was situnned for a considerable time, but finally recovering, asked Peter for his horse, as he purposed moving back.
