It was a heavenly-born ini- pulse, and a noble resolve, that actuated the promoters of the new departure, and the funda mental principle, motive and intent of their act, was to pro vide a common school educa tion, to give to every child in Virginia an opportunity to learn his  3 Rs at the public expense, so that the poorer children of Virginia may not continue to grow up in ignor ance as their ancestors had done, and the good work has gone on and thousands of Buckingham children during the past 30 years have availed themselveB of their oppor tunity, and have equipped themselves through the public funds with an education suf ficient to enable them to earr their living in the world and yet they have not all been reached. There are to-day manyhow many I cannot tell hut judging from this small magisterial district, there musi he some hundreds of children in the county who are cut off from all the benefits of the school fund by location and envirorment, and the craze for the  consolidated school is mainly responsible for the de privation of these back woods children of even the rudiments of an education This state of affairs ought not to be. It was never expected, or the thought conceived by the founders of the public school movement, that tbe taxes collected from a generous public to give the poor boy and girl of Bucking ham an elementary education should be diverted to pay a high priced teacher to polish up Mr. Nearby and Mr. Well- offs son or daughter in al gebra, music, latin and other trimmings, whilst the little bare-foot waif of the ridges and back woods had not even a chance to reach a school within 3, 4, or 5 miles. Such is the state of affairs in Buckingham County to-day, and if high officials and aspir ing teachers have their way. I fear it is to grow worse, and I call upon tbe Board of School Trustees to ponder well the condition and position of these outlying sections of our county, and not let the  High School at the Court House, or Arvon sweep them off their feet, but bark back to first principles and foster the Primary School first, and thus carry out the plans and intentions of the founders and the tax-payers. I am not an enemy to educa tion any more than I am to the automobile or the air-ship when a man is  fore handed, and owes no debts he may own and ride in his car or ship, but I do protest against a man cut ting such shines when he is still owing his grocer for sugar, coffee, c., or his tailor for the suit of clothes he is wearing and so with the classics and higher mathematics, the read ing and expounding of Virgil and Homer by teachers paid out of the public funds co sons and daughters of the well-to do and conveniently located whilst the poor mans child on the out-skirts of a school dist rict is shut out of distance and pecuniary famine from even acquiring at public expense even the rudiments of his mother tongue it is worse than an error, it is a crime.
