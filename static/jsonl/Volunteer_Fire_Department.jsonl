Bill Austin, chief of the RHFD, says the building which will house the departments vehicles and equipment should be completed by May of this year. He ndtes that there are still many details which must be tended to before the new volunteer fire department may go into service,, however. Oat biggest problem is that we still peed a lot of equipm ent, notes A ustin. Austin says the volunteers need coats, helmets, boots, air packs, portable pumps, hoses, nozzles, various small . tools such as axes and spanner wrenches to tighten hose nozzles, radio equipment, and sirens. The radio equipment, which will be the departments most expensive equipment exclud ing the vehicles, will include a central monitoring unit and individual monitoring units for the members. Austin says the Red House Fire Department .will be monitored through the Charlotte Court House Sheriffs Department. Austin adds that a fire department siren will be placed somewhere in the village. But all this equipment is still needed before the volunteers can begin fighting fires, adds Austin. The RHFD was organized in August of 1979 by the late Len Elder, who also made a 10,000 contribution to the department shortly before his death this year. Those funds were used to get started on the building which will house the fire equipment. The department owns two firefighting trucks, a Chevrolet and a LaFrance, currently being kept at Austins home, and in the barn of Melvin"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Volunteer", "Fire", "Department"], "snippet": "the new Ited House <mark>Volunteer</mark> <mark>Fire</mark> <mark>Department</mark> building, and, according to"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Volunteer", "Fire", "Department"], "snippet": "the new Ited House <mark>Volunteer</mark> <mark>Fire</mark> <mark>Department</mark> building, and, according to"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The wild ponies of Chincoteague have made that section of Eastern. Shore familiar to the nation and famous to the world, and visitors from distant lands are common. ISvery year about this time the men jf Chincoteague Island come to Assateague, the area in which the ponies are really located, for the wild pony roundup. These little animals are spotted, corraled and driven to gether on the beach and at low tide are brought over to Chincoteague Island, some 200 yards of water away, where they are herded into enclosures awaiting the annual pony sale. During the remaining of the year the refuge manager of Chincoteague keeps a watchful eye on the stock of animals on the island, allowing them to multiplly and graze on the refuge without interference by man, ac cording to the Virginia Travel Coun cil. Just how the ponies ever got to this island is uncertain and is still shrouded by mystery, tall tales and legend. Some are of the opinion that they swam ashore after a shipwreck near the island others believe they belonged to a band of pirates who failed to recover their animals after allowing them to graze.

A new and much more handsome State building, it is said, will beereoted at once. The session of the Legislature will continue at Harrisburg, although it was stated at first that both Sen ate and House would hold their future meet ings during this session in either Philadel phia or Pittsburg, to both of which they were Invited when the destructive character of the fire became known. The Senate wilt meet In tbe Supremo courtroom and the House will meet In a room on tha seoond floor of tbe posteffice building. Governor Hastings la expected to send a message to tbe Legislature Immediately in referenoe to tbe destruction of the. capltol building and recommending Immediate ac tion on the part ot th Legislator with a view to the restoration ot th capltol build ing. The volunteer fire department ot Harris burg Is held partly to blame for the rapid spread of th flames because of its alleged tardiness in responding to the fire alarms When the fir was first discovered the House of Delegates was in session and th. Senate was about to convene after a few minutes recess. Smoke was seen In email volumes pouring out lute the Capltol grounds from th House window. The members were not mindful of It until the great elouda rolled by the window. In stantly there was a motion to adjourn and all was oonstarnatlon. The Senate chamber was crowded with members Senator John O. Grady, ot Philadelphia, warned the Sena tors, and there was a general hustle to re move effects. Fire alarms were sent In and soon the Senate was a mass of howling men. Desks were hastily carried out Th same work was done in the Hous chamber. The departments In the burned building were tbe following Senate and House, all ot tbe committee rooms, the Senate librarians room, Sonata ehlef olerks room, smoking- room, barber shop In Senate, Lieutenant- Governors room, room of President pro tern., school department, House chief clerks room, Speaker of Houses room, resident clerks room, two telegraph offices, room of tbe Har risburg Legislative Correspondents Associa tion, pasters and folders departments, cloak rooms of both brahobes and th engine- rooms.

We will have a meeting of the building committee a soon as theJHouse and Senate committees can he appointed, There is not much over 100,00 Insurance on tha building and contents, according to the statement of the treasury officials. There was 400,000 on tha cspttol building while the State library was in It. After it was re moved to another structure the Insurance on tbe legislative halls was reduced to 60,000. In addition to this there Is 123,000 insur ance carried on all tbe State buildings. The State oapltol was a plain but substan tial brick building, the cornerstone of which was laid seventy-eight years ago. The orig inal tract of four acres for tbe capltol build ings was a donation from John Harris,-the founder of Harrleburg. Subsequently ten acres and five lota adjoining were bought by th State for 2,100, a small portion ot this land being resold in 1828 for 412. Thus It will be scan that the orlglual tract of land only cost the State 1,688. The construction of the capltol buildings cost  135,000, the cor nerstone being laid In 1819, and tbe first Leg islature meeting in It In 1822.

Lawson Monday night reported to the Town Council that excavation for the two acre sewage lagoon is al most complete. Two members of the Appomat tox Volunteer Fire Department appeared before the Council to ask for consideration of a new building to house equipment and a meeting place. C. R. Skinney Wooldridge and Dick Bass said they had located a piece of land the Bledsoe property and that seller, S. L. Lawson, had named a reasonable price. They said they would need a four stall building, plus upstairs area, and that one of the four stalls could be used as a wash pit. Council requested that they obtain tentative plans and an idea of how much such a build ing will cost. Mrs. W. W. Burke appeared before Council to review the work done by the RAD Centenn ial subcommittee and the sub sequent development of Appo mattox Heritage, Incorporated. We feel we have a unique story to tell, she said, in des cribing the proposed Sound - Light production for the Sur render Grounds. In a Sound- Light production, there are no live characters, she explained, and no screen to watch. While the story is being told via tape recording, lights are turned on in various buildings, or field areas are lit to reenact historical events. She said that a contribution by Council now would make it poss ible to bring Dr. Gordon Graham here to draw up plans for the production and to work full time on a job that has become too big for the volunteer help given thus far. Graham, she said, would act as executive di rector, but would be under the direct control of the board of directors of Appomattox Heri tage, Inc. Among other things being done in the sound-light planning, she said, is a survey of motel and hotel accomodations in a thirty mile radius. Dr. Lawson said that success ful production at the Park will be one of the biggest boons to this town in the last 109 years.
