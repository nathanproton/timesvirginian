At its regular meeting Garland Rodes Camp, Sons of Veterans, of Lynchburg, selected as their sponsor for the coming Confederate reunion Miss Rebecca Martin and as maid of honor Miss Norvie Craighill. both of that city. The Veterans have invited ex-Gov. Francis T. Nichols, who is spending the summer at Chase City, to attend the reunion and be one of the speakers. _ A call was issued by George E.

James Norton, of Medford,_ Mass., has discovered what he claimi to be the richest nickel mine in the United States on the edge of Floyd county, 10 miles south o f ShaWsville, on the Norfolk and Western railway.

A drastic anti-gambling ordinance just enacted by the Roanoke City Council provides for a fine of not less than 50 nor more than 500 fot gaming. Mayor Cutchin says that he will permit no games of chance at the Roanoke fair in September. Mayor Joel H. Cutchin, of Roanoke, who was recently re-elected, in an in terview said he had given his time, attention and very best efforts to the city for two years and that his poli tical opponents have made the posi tion as unpleasant as possible. The Council, he says, has continually fought him in everything he attempts to do in the interest of the city, and recent proceedings he fears is an in dication that the same tactics will con tinue in the new Council. If so, he cannot and will not stand it. Some whom he thought were. his friends have shown an animosity that does not please him. He says the salary, which is less than any officer, police man or blacksmith of the city, is no compensation for the duties he is called upon to perform, to say nothing of a continual wrangle with the Coun cil, which is annoying to him and humiliating and distasteful to his rela tives and family. The Mayor says that the office has destroyed his law business and the continued harassing has injured his health and peace of mind. He says that if present condi tions continue no gentleman can- or will be Mayor of Roanoke. W. E.

In 1941, just a year after I was to have been paid off for the last time, the Japanese attacked the Naval Air Station, Pearl Harbor. I was working in the galley there at the time.

It is to be supposed that there is as much brains m the United States to-day as there ever was before. Aud yet it seems that there has never been a time in our history when there were a few men in pub lic life who rise above their fellows as at the present. Meu who are en gaged iu the affairs of government, or who are ordinarily spoken of as candidates for high office, seem to be almost on a dead level of mediocrity. In neither house of Congress s there a man who is regarded as a leader and a statesman above his fel lows. Senator Hoar is a man of abil- ty, doubtless, but he had iu recent years shown more of a ctpacity to be led than to lead. Sen-itor llauna is the most influential man in the Sen- ite, but not by virtue of statesman hip. He possesses none of the quail ies which made the great Senators of the ante-bellum period leaders, and none of the brilliance of the la ter Eepublicans, such as Oliver P. Morton, Conkling and Blaine. With the death of Hendricks, Thurman, Bayard, and the retirement from public life of Mr. John G. Carlisle, the Democratic party has been much iu the same plight. When one be gins to discuss party candidates for the Presidency in 1904 no one is able to mention a tolerably available man in either party whose name is famil iar to all the people as were the names of Hendricks, Bayard or Conkling. The name of Mr. Thom as B. Heed is familiar enough, but he is not keeping step with his party, and he does not possess the knack of catching step which Senator Hoar so eminently possesses. When Mr. Heed and Mr. William L. Wilson re tired from the House of Repre sentatives, there were no Elishas in their respective parties upon whom they could drop their mantles. It may be that the best statesmen we possess find it impossible to adjust their views to party policies. In the old days this was not necessary, as the party policies were formulat ed by the statesmen themselves and not by the mere politicians. It may he that the best talent of the country is not available for the United States Government because of the superior inducements offered by the great corporations or by the rewards of labor in other walks of private life. Whatever the reason may be the fact is to be deplored.Baito.

The Richmond Times Washington correspondence Monday, says The question of the successorship to Judge Bond is one which is receiving a consideration in Virginia which has been unparalleled within the history of the State for the number of good men who are absolutely seek ing the office rather than the office seeking them. This is not the fact with the men whose names I have or will mention, as they are men whose friends and acquaintances have un- stintingly recommended them, inde pendent of theirown preferences in the matter. Virginia is the only onb of the States comprising the district, save that of South Carolina, which has not now a flattering representation in the federal judiciary, and conse quently it would seem within the bounds of legitimate reason that Mr Cleveland would well consider the candidacy of its meritorious citizens. In South Carolina the state of affairs is such that the President would hardly dare make an appointment without feeling assured that he an tagonized some element of Democ racy, and thus in our Commonwealth alone does he find a number of capa ble eligible and worthy men, which from their standpoint would natur ally be the subject of his considera tion. The story that Mr. Clevelands former desires to appoint Judge Keith, of Warren ton, asohief justice of the District Court, is fresh in the minds of all of our people, and the fact that his commission, already made out, was withheld only at the personal request of Judge Thurman, who was his partner upon the national ticket, warrants, at least, the assumption that now the judge may receive his most favorable inves tigation. It is reported today that Senator Ransom, of North Carolina, is a candidate for this position, and his recent action in the Senate may have some tendency to impress upon the President his claims, yet the fact remains that Senator Ransom has not been in active practice for more than twenty years, and indulging, as he has continuously, in the details of politics, he has detracted very much from what years ago would have been a formidable application. The two latest aspirants for the office are said to be Judge S. G. Whittle of Henry county, and Judge Berryman Green, of Danville, both of whom are gentlemen well equipped for the place in question. However, they will hardly be considered by the President in advance of Con gressman Tucker, the Hon. C. V. Meredith, of Richmond, or others whose claims have already been pre sented. Beyond all of this there may be possibly a surprise in store for the people of Virginia, growing out of the fact that Mr. Cleveland has always proven a man of surprises. The average guesser would hardly suppose that Senator John W. Dan iel would be selected for a place like this, owing especially to the fact that he led the opposition to Mr. Cleveland in the State campaign of 1892, and during the recent debate in the Senate he has preferred to ally himself with the interests which were most pronounced to the panacea propounded by the President. Yet the appointment of ex-Senator Eustis  of Louisana, to the Court of St. Jamees was no more of surprise than ! that which would be created by the appointment of Senator Daniel, and j yet Mr. Cleveland named him for ! that important post. The adminis- ! tration has already signified to some of the callers that the candidacy of Major Holmes Conrad and General Lee for the United States Senate was equally agreeable to the President, and that he would aid them as far as possible The appointment of Sen ator Daniel will leave, of course, an opportunity for both of these gentle men to come into the United States Senate, and while it is assured that I one of these places will be captured by either General Hunton or Hon. j Thomas S. Martin, of Scottsville, it is possible that Mr. Cleveland would j prefer to have any of the allies in"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Thurman"], "snippet": "personal request of Judge <mark>Thurman</mark>, who was his partner"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Thurman"], "snippet": "personal request of Judge <mark>Thurman</mark>, who was his partner"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
