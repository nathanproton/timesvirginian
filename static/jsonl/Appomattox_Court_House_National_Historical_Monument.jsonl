The purpose of this investigation is two-j fold to check the Hancock-Hubard I drawings and specifications and to find new facts. The overall dimen sions of the house, as worked out by the archeologist, check almost to the inch with the Hancock-Hu bard data. New finds were to be ex pected because Hancock made the plans for his own infomation and had the actual material to use in the rebuilding and thus naturally eft out certain data. One of the finds was the stone and brick hearth on the ground flood. Also uncovered were remnants of the old wood stringers that supported the ground floor boards, as well as a drainage pit designed to keep the basement dry at all times.

The Appomattox Court House National Historical Monument, a unit of the National Park Service, commemorates the ending of the Wrr Between the States and the re union of America.

After the rebuilding of the court house at a new site, now the town of Appomattox, the old village de clined. One of the first jobs under- aken by the men of Camp NP28 was the removal of honeysuckle and the dense corpses of locust trees that had grown around the de serted village.  Next they began the removal of non-histpric struc tures and the preliminary recondi tioning of the old houses to be res tored. During the coming months more clearing .will be done to ap proximate the 18,5 appearance of he village and further work on the restoration of the historic houses will be undertaken.. Another CCC _ob of importance is fire hazard re duction in the wooded areas of the Monument. In the near future a by-pass road, to be a part of Virginia Highway 24, will be built around the old village in order that the village site can be completely restored to its historic appearance. At present, Highway 24 runs directly through the village. Rock for this by-pass road has been gathered and crush ed by the CCC men and more is to be obtained soon and1 a quarry to be opened on park property. Most interesting of the develop ments at the Old Court House is the excavation of the McLean House siie. Here CCC enrollees are care fully digging out the foundation bounds preparatory to the actual work of reconstruction. An histori cal study of the house and its ap pearance has been completed, based on old writings, photographs, draw ings and plans made at the time of the demolition of the house. P. C.

Mrs. Fergusons former home is now the office of the Appomattox Court House National Historical Monument. They expressed the belief that Mrs. Mary Ellen Hickok, of San Diego, California, might remember something of the old tavern. Her grandfather, Wilson Hix, was the owner at the time of the surrender. A letter was dispatched to Mrs. Hickok, who answered not only with written information, but also with a detailed map-drawing showing all the tavern  buildings and gsounds in de tail. The tavern was her home until she was fourteen years old. A good deal of the information supplied corroborated previous suppositions and some was entirely new. An ex ample of he value of this informa tion is the question of the wooden wing on the west end of the main tavern building j this wing was known to have existed in 1865 it shows up in a wartime photograph, out he trees and shadows obscure details Mrs. Hickok furnishes the first definite knowledge of this wing. It was used as a dining room, and has long since been removed. De tails of the two brick annexes, which were used as guest houses, are also shown, as well as a wooden ser vants quarters behind the main house. The wooden structure stood until recent years, and the three brick structures still stand. Inform ation such as that supplied by Mrs. Hickok will enable the National Park Service to restore the tavern group to its 1865 condition with perfect fidelity. The tavern, according to old re cords, was built in 1819, by Alexan der Patteson and was an important itage stop on the line between Cum berland! County and Lynchburg, wned by Patteson and his brother, Lilburne. In the middle nineteen hundreds the spot was a thriving place, with coaches hearing such ro mantic names as  The Davy Crock ett, her of the Alamo, plying the ,ild stage route. At the time of the formation of Appomattox County, in 1845, the tavern was the property of Captain John Raine. Clover Hill, the name of the place, attached It self to the county seat which was established there in the 1840s, and the town at the time of Lees sur -  render was known both as Appo mattox Court House and Clover Hill the name Clover Hiil still survives as a magesterial distict Such information as hat supplied by Mis.

The residence was the home of George Peers, county court clerk. New comfort stations, in the re constructed slave quarters at the Old Tavern, will be completed this month and the Tavern itself is being given a handsome reconstruction job. It will be used for National Park Serv ice offices, and will house the enlarg ed museum. New museum exhibits are expect ed to arrive the week of April 18, to add to the many historical relics now on display. The museum has been located in the old Ferguson residence, where there hag not been room for adequate display. A continuous effort goes to ob tain museum items for Appomattox. Many of the items secured during the past year have been sent to Park Service shops to be prepared for ex hibit, and some of these items are now ready for public view. The mu seum in the restored Tavern is ex pected to be a mecca for tourists. Mr. Gurney announced today that 5,800 is now available for buildirg an utility house east of the Peers House. This will furnish storage space, workshop and housing for tools. Work will begin very soon on this project. The program of the Park Serv ice is a restoration of the Old Court Houte Village. The McLean House itself was the top item in the pro gram and-4to dedication brought one of the largest crowds ever in A ddo - mattox.

In Washington this week, final ap proval was voted for a change in the name of the National Park Serv- ice establishment here. The new name will be Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. This replaces the use of the word Monument in the designation, held to be an inadequate descrip tion of the restoration. The bill to change the name was introduced in ttie House by Congressman W. M.
