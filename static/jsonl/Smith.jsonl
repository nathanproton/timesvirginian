Ill range up at the judgment seat with you! flamed Manning. Were both old enough td think about that! Joseph G. Clark jumped to his feet and, leaning across the table, shook a thin forefinger at Manning. I have been attacked enough on the point of my moral standing! he de clared, his high-pitched nasal voice quavering with an anger he had held below the explosive point during the most of his life. I can stand the at tacks of a sensational press, but when spiteful criticism follows me into my own vestry, almost in the sacred shadow of the altar itself, 1 am com pelled to protest! I wish to state to this vestry, once and for all, that my moral status is above reproach, and that my conduct has been such as to receive the commendation of my Ma ker! Because it has pleased Divine Providence to place in my hands the distribution of the grain of the fields, I rfm constantly subject to the attacks of envy and malice! It has gone so far that I, last night, received froqj Rev. Smith Boyd, a request to resign from this vestry! He paused in tri umph on that, as if he had made against Rev. Smith Boyd a charge of such ghastly infamy that the young rector must shrivel before his eyes. I have led a blameless life! I have never smoked nor drunk! I have paid every penny I ever owed and fulfilled every promise I ever n!ade. 1 have obeyed the gospel and partaken of the sacraments, and the Divine Being has rewarded me abundantly! He has Chosen me, because of my faithful stewardship, to gather the food of earth from its sources and feed it to the mouths of the hungry  and I shall not depart from my stewardship in this church, because I am here, as I am everywhere, by the will of God! Perhaps W. T. Chisholm was not shocked by this blasphemy, but the dismay of it sat on every other face, even on that of Nicholas Van Ploon, whp was compelled to dig deep to flnd his ethics. You Infernal old thief! wondered Manning, recovering from his amaze ment. Was it Divine Providence which directed you to devise the scheme whereby the railroads paid you two dollars rebate on every car of wheat you shipped, and a dollar bonus on every car of wheat your com petitors shipped? I could give youi string of sins as long as the catechism and you dare not deny one of them, because I can prove them on you! And yet you have the effrontery to say that a Divine Providence would estab lish you in your monopoly, by such scoundrelly means as you have risen to become the greatest dispenser of self-advertising charities in the world! You propose to ride into heaven on your universities and your libraries, and on the fact that you never smoked n6r drank nor swore nor gambled but when you come face to face with this horrible new god you have cre ated, a deity who would permit you to attain wealth by the vile methods you have used, you will find him with a pitchfork in his hands! I am glad that Doctor Boyd, though knowing your vindictive record, has had brav ery enough to demand your resigna tion from this vestry! I hope he re ceives it! . Joseph G.

However, due to confusion with the Old Ap pomattox Court House community, the \u00f1am\u00e9 of the post office here changed on January 15, 189 to West Appomattox, Virginia. It oper ated under that name until June 27, 1906, when it took the present name of Appomattox, Virginia. The office became third class in 1909 and second class in 1987. In mid-1955 it is scheduled to become first class, due to volume of busi ness. Several years ago it became first class, but reverted to second class due to a shift in parcel post business. The following is a list of post masters and their terms Samuel D. MeDearmon, February 23, 1855 Richard H, Mavin, December 31. 1855 Robert I, Boaz, October 4, 1866 Thomas E.

However, this was not the first pqst. office in what is now Appomat tox County, Tie following inform ation  supplied by the National Archives and reports of the Post Office Department Appomattox County, Virginia The records show that this office was established on April 1, 1811, under the name of Floods, Buckings ham County, Virginia, with Thomas Trent the first postmaster. It is shown that the name oi the county was changed to Prince Edward on March 22, 1837, that the name of the office was changed to Clover Hill on July 7, 1837 and that the county in which the office was lo cated was changed to Appomattox sometime between September 23, 1845 and June 30, 1849. The re cords show that the name of the office was changed to Appomattox Court House on February 3, 1859 and changed to Appomattox on July 3, 1892.  It therefore appears that the his tory of a post office at what is now without a post office but known as Old Appomattox Court House, is equally interesting. That part of the county was in Buckingham when the post office was established as Floods in 1811. Later it became a part of Prince Edward and finally Appo mattox in 1845. Shortly after the burning of the court house in 1892, the court house was rebuilt at what is now the Town of Appomattox, and final ly the post office at the historic old village was discontinued. It was of ficially Appomattox Court House, Virginia, at the time Gen. Lee sur rendered to Gen. Grant. Undocumented stories often told here relate that in the gold rush days a hundred years and more ago?- some family started out for Ne braska, got this far and liked the place so much that they decided to settle here and call this Nebraska.

Why do you ask? T v e just had all my white Leg horns stolenforty of them. Every one round here is losing chickens. Now those chickens have to be mar keted somewhereand not around here. Its fifty miles to the city, which is the safest place to m arket them. If I stole chickens, Id freight them down, dressed and packed in barrels. So I thought if anybody round here was doing the thieving and the thieves, whoever they are, take the local paper, and certainly do know this part of the county as well as their hand  I m ight get some hint from your shipments. Thats a first rate idea, said the young man. But I dont remember any special shipper of dressed poul try in barrels. The W alter boys pack that way, but I guess were not sus pecting them! Mrs. Dixon sends a barrel now and then. So do the peo ple on the Lawrence farm th ats been an experimental poultry farm for the last year. I hear they report they lost badly through a raid by the thieves two months ago. The Elliotts, over at Orwell, send dressed poultry, too, but never very much. It doesnt seem------- .No, it doesnt, said Dorothy, looking perplexed. But these chick ens have got to get to market, Frank, somehow. Ive started to hunt this county over till I find whats become of them. I guess Id better drive to the other stations up and down the road. Theyd be likely to choose a stupid agent to ship through, so I dnt wonder they keep away from here. Then she flushed a t having paid Frank a compliment, and Frank flushed, too, with pleasure, for he knew that his pretty schoolmate never said things unless she meant them. It p u t him on his mettle. But see here, Dorothy, why do you have to drive up and down the road? W hats the m atter with my telegraphing instead? Come in and sit down, and I ll get you all the in formation you want in half an hour. So Dorothy sat and listened to the clicking w.ires, and took some brief notes on a telegraph pad that Frank pushed over to her across the table. Wagner, at Dorrance station, says that the Lawrence farm sends a bar rel now and then and a crate occa sionally. The Widow Ransom is the heaviest shipper sends both crates and barrels. Jones, at Pond station, says Hank Janeway ships a barrel sometimes so does the Lawrence farm. The Browns send a crate now and then white Leghorns and Ply mouth Rocks. Collins, at Pelham Junction, says that Mrs. Robinson ships more than anybody else, but Jim Henry sends a barrel or a crate now and then, and so does the Law rence peoplePlymouth Rocks, most ly. King, at Bellevue station, says everybody sends in crates, except a barrel now and then from the Law rence people and Sally W alker. Frank leaned back and whistled softly. Dorothy smiled and pushed the telegraph pad under his eyes. Five underlinings marked the name Lawrence repeated in each of the five reports from Milby, Dorrance, Pond, Pelham and Bellevue. You clever girl! said Frank. Youve got hold of the right end. No honest poultry farm ever shipped that much to the city, and through five different stations in small lots. But supposing its so, how are we go ing to prove it? The man doesnt live who can identify an ordinary white Leghorn hen or Plymouth Rock pul let. But the girl does! cried Dorothy, triumphantly. Since day before yesterday I can pick out any one of my forty Leghorns with absolute cer tainty, Frank. I I dipped their legs, every one of them, in a fast black that wont come off, so that I could know them again if they were stolen. Frank Evans lay back in his chair and laughed delightedly. Dorothy, you always were at the head of the class, he said, heartily. But what are you going to do now? Im going to the Lawrence farm , said Dorothy, unfastening the hitch ing strap. You mustnt do that. They might do you an injury. W ait till I can get a constable and a search warrant. You m ustnt go alone, Dorothy. , I wont have it. I dont mind a search w arrant, said Dorothy, with composure. That is what I brought this for. She pulled out the mysterious box, and disclosed various brightly labeled bottles and packages. I am Miss Jane Smith, Frank, agent for these poultry remedies, which I am driv ing about the county introducing among intelligent poultry farmers. I shall get into the Lawrence chicken yards, and come away again without any trouble, thank you. But I should like the constable to be at the end of the lane, ready to come in a little later.
