PAULETTE With so much thought and energy going into the Historic Appomattox Railroad Festival, a backward glance at the Depot seems in order. It was n the year of 1852 that the first railroad was built through the county of Appomattox. It was called the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad. The first passenger train went through Appomattox enroute tp Roanoke in November of 1852. At that time the engine was fired with wood the wood was cut, hauled, and stacked along side the tracks. Some time later the railroad was renamed The Virginian and Tennessee Railroad. Today it is the Norfolk and Western Railway System. In notes- belonging to Miss Nola Burkey, a- retired elementary school teacher, we find  the following. According to the late Nathaniel Gregory,-the first railroad station was just a boxcar. Some time later a station proper was built.
