It is alleged that such proceedings as were carried on four years ago were very distasteful to many of the citizens of the county and for that reason the rank and file of voters are slow to express their choice for fear of the recurrence of hostile feeling. While no doubt man j have de cided views a to whom they will vote for, but little or no pub lic demonstrations have taken place throughout the county and while a few public gatherings have been held, the attendance at these meetings have been small and little interest in such meetings have been manifested. For the house of delegates, Col. A. J. Terrell is opposed by D- N. Gannaway, both of Buck ingham. Colonel Terrell being a candidate for what is called the organizations forces and Mr, Gannaway representing t h e antis. In this, like other county contests, there has been no issue and the fight hangs chiefly on personalities. In some quarters, the question of the short ballot issue has been in jected in which Mr. Gannaway ias declared himself as opposed to the short ballot, while no such statement has come from Mr. Terrell other than he is for the administration policies. As the short ballot, is an administra tion policy, however, it is regard ed that Mr. Terrell is for it, and su far, that is about the main is sue involved between the two candidates for that office.

The present i levies run from 1.80 to 1.95. The reduction is expected to cause a bolstering of confidence locally and will be warmly wel comed by tax payers. No con certed demand for a reduction had been made by citizens, but the supervisors and county of f a l s felt that the cut was in .ine with steps already taken by several other counties. The supervisors also felt it best to act in advance of widespread dissatisfaction that might be forthcoming if theratewere not . educed and wisely averted any m a s s meetings of tax payers such as a number of other coun ies have experienced. Th i s act is expected to renew confi dence in the administration of county affairs, and cooperation -vill now be sought in an effort -o avoid drastic cut in upkeep jf roads and the conduct of the jchools. The- statement signed by county supervisors, follows To T h e Taxpayers of Appo mattox Count Realizing the financial con dition of the farmers and citi zens of our county, brought about by the drought of last year, a n d the unprecedented depression whichwe are pass ing, and small demand and low prices for all farm products, and while all of us now receive the lowest salary and compen sation allowed by state laws, but desiring to help relieve the tax burden of o u r people to some extent, hereby express cur willingness and voluntarily agree to accept a ten per cent cut in salary or compensation for the year beginning January 1st, 1932, and pledge ourselves to do everything possible to practice economy in the admin istration of the county affairs, so that the county, school and road levy m a y be reduced to the lowest possible figure. The above ten per cent does not ap ply to the County Treasurer or the Commissioner of the Rev enue, as the reduction in levy automatically reduces their compensation more than ten per cent. C. W.

We are sure we can make a substantial reduction in the levy for th e next fiscal year, and agree to make the total levy 1.50 on the 100.00 for all purposes, thus reducing the taxes of the people approxi mately 12,450.00. We real ize this means a substantial cut in county affairs, road building, and length of school term.

Uhe tax ticket, which is in good stace of preservation, then has space to itemize the agricultural products qf the tax payer, under the folio,wing headings Corn, short corn, buck wheat, rice, Irish potatoes, cured fodder, sugar, molasses of cane, mo lasses of sorghum, cotton, peas, jeans, ground peas.  Opposite each item is space for listing the gross  quantity, deductions, quality, tithe of one tenth and value of tenth. The tax payer, in this case, Mr. Davidson, had to pay for a tithe of  20 bushels of corn he grew 260 bushels of corn but was allowed a deduction of 60 bushels fed to pork or 6.00 in cash tithe of 9 bushels of Irish potatoes, or 1.35 in cash ahd tithe of 150 pounds of cured fodder, or 30 cents in cash total tax of 7.65. He had to make af fidavit for the truthfulness of the statement, and that he had 13 hogs to eat the 50 bushels oi rorn ey ducted.  Are your taxes heavy? Perhaps so, but at least you dont have to tithe! 1 We thank Mr. Burke and Mr. Davidson for loaning us this inter esting sidelight on conditions in Ap pomattox 75 years ago."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["R", "L", "Burke", "treasurer"], "snippet": "one-tenth, for the Government? <mark>R</mark> <mark>L</mark>. <mark>Burke</mark>, county <mark>treasurer</mark>, has loaned us a"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["R", "L", "Burke", "treasurer"], "snippet": "one-tenth, for the Government? <mark>R</mark> <mark>L</mark>. <mark>Burke</mark>, county <mark>treasurer</mark>, has loaned us a"}], "text_match": 2314894167458709625, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "4419510861824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "2314894167458709625", "tokens_matched": 4, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The remainder of the time it my office in The Bank of Ap bomattox- I Since taxes are a first lien m your personal property as well as real estate, it is most important that you get your axes paid before Dec. 4, 1930 when a 5 penalty is added o all unpaid bills. It is always good business co pay your taxes before the penalty s added, but is es pecially so this year in view bf the business depression as it costs you from 10 to 20 interests o allow tickets to go an penalty. In order to meet the running expenses of the schools, roads, and other current expenses of your County promptly, and to save yourselves the addition al expenes caused by delay, I hope that there will be few tax payers Who w i l l allow their taxes to go on penalty.
