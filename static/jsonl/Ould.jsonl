If the United States government were to take such action, then the states might help the cause by enacting parallel, legislation, but many people remain to be convinced that outlawing this party is the best means of dealing with it. Unless we are wholly misinformed, the Com munist party in Virginia is a negli gible political force, and though no Communist outfit relies greatly upon numerical strength we doubt that the one in Virginia is potent by any test. Dealing sternly with Communists in government or other vital places is one thing, but proscribing the party is something else again and a step which should not be taken without due debileration by a state which has had a great deal to d0 with defining and establishing civil liberties in America. We question that any people who would over throw government by force are en titled to the protection of its livil liberties, but until there is a real danger we ould safely p stpcne giving the answer. As yet we see no reason to revise the view that an individual has a right to be a Com munist but that lie should be willing to stand up and be counted sad ac cept the disability which public epiaioa puts upon him."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["ould"], "snippet": "a real danger we <mark>ould</mark> safely p stpcne giving"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["ould"], "snippet": "a real danger we <mark>ould</mark> safely p stpcne giving"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

They were in formed with an indifferent smile, that they had other important du ties and home affairs claiming their time, and their quarters could be better spent elsewhere than on the dead. In one seuse this is true. We have home duties and try not to neglect them, aud the monev ould be possibly more wisely spent While we do this to honor our dead, we try also to impress npo. the minds of the children of the county, hat the Confederate cause was just .ml right and thatthir fathers were not rebellious traitors and to give them a desire to acquire knowledge of the events of their country, and to teach, them to be patriotic aud proud of their South-land and an cestors. The little knowledge, be ginning here may grow in the minds and hearts of each, and be of great benefit to all. The president of the U. D. C. thought last year of giviug up the charter of the Appo mattox Chapter U. D. C. on account of the ladies lack of interest in this county. She wrote the National l D. C. president, and the Virginia president U. D. C. to that effect, stating she would join a chapter in Lynchburg. Letters from the Va. division, S. C. division and Md. di vision came pouring in not to let Appomattox surrender the second time also sending a list of names of prominent ladies who would join among them, Miss Ruth Early, Mrs. James Garnett, Miss M. Amelia Smith, the piesideut of Va. division U. D. C. and the daughter of ex-Gov Wm. Smith of Va., known as Ex tra Billy. The letter expressed surprise at the Appomattox ladies not caring to join one of the largest organizations m the whole south and living in one of the most his torical counties in the world. It is quite a reflection upon the county. We revised the roll and now have ouly eighteen members lu t they say they intend to keep up the or ganization and to be proud they are U. O C. of Appomattox and we shall be more than pleased if Coal ing will forward us the names ot the ladies desiring to join the IT, D. C. or the Memorial Association or any one reading this would like to become a member of either society please forward their name to Mrs. T. A. Smith, president of the Mem orial Association or Mrs. C. W. Hunter, president of U. D. C. West Appomattox. One prominent aim of the U. D. C. is to gather histori cal facts to help the historians of the U. D. 0. historical committee in collecting war experiences, inci dents and reminiscences of the old soldiers, their wives, daughters or any one who can remember during the Civil war. The U. D. C. es pecially requests, Mrs. T. W. Johns to write up hers and Capt. Johns also Mrs. George Miles, Mrs. A. H. Bocock, Major Flood, Mr. Chap Chilton, Drs. Wm. White and Wm. H. Ahbitt, Mrs. Mary Ann Robert son, Mr. Kirk Hannah and any one who will help us, also send us news paper clippings or Magazines or Journals or anything bearing on the war between the states. This is to help in having a correct history of the south. Please dont think yours will not be of service or interest for it may show up the spirit of the times more than you think.

Of coarse he was a t once colled upon to tell the story. Five years ago, toe Englishman said, I took the 6 oclock train one morning from Bristol to go to a town about 20 miles distant It was a local branch reed. As yon are no doubt aware, the English loco motives are not furnished with comfort able cabs for engineer and firemanor as we call them, the driver and toe stokeras yours are.

Our txsin had gone on without incident for some m il, when 1, who was te one of the foremost carriages, heard load voioes, apparently of persons te a violent quarrel somewhere te front of me. I put my head out of the carriage window and saw that the engine driver and stoker were engaged te a fight on the engine. Their angry words became fewer and fewer as their blows rained thicker and thicker upon each other. Finally they clutched to a desperate struggle. Thedriv- ar seemed to be engaged to on attempt to force the stoker off the engine. I shouted to toe guard, bnt he was out oi hearing la toe after part of the train. Nearer and nearer the two desperate men come to the step of the engine. The driver gave his antagonist a desperate push. The stoker saw tost he was gone, but clung to the driver. A last terrible struggle and over both went to the ground. This left the engine entirely unattended. Evidently the steam had been left fully turned on, tor the train began to rash for ward at an increasing rate of speed. On and on we went at a pace white became terrible. No one could get to the locomo tive, and no one knew how to handle it if he could have got there. We whizzed past a station where we should hove stopped and caught glimpses of astonished fives looking at as. Past another station, past a third, post a fourth, on we whirled at even a swifter speed. Then we all knew that the next station was a terminus. When we reached that, we should be hurled against a boiler, and the train would be wrecked. W hat was to be done? Nothing was done. We plunged on and on. The terminus came into view. I t came nearer and nearer, seeming to bulge swiftly into greater size a we bore down upon it.

While the results of this legislation have not been large during the two months it has been in efTect, 110 men having been enrolled up to September 1,1915, it is believed that an increasing number of men, whose enlistments expire, will take advantage of the opportunity offered and it is al ready having the effect of increasing the number of re-enlistments.

Vigorous opposition to any reduction of the permanent army below 380,000 enlisted men and 18,000 officers proposed by the Senate Military Committee was voiced in the Senate by Senator Wadsworth, New York, in charge of the Army Reorgan ization bill Senator Frellnghuysen, New Jersey, and others. Senator Wadsworth had moved to eliminate amendments providing for a gradual decrease in the size of the army. He explained that these de creases had been agreed upon by the committee after proposals for com pulsory military training had been ap proved and that since the Senate had voted against such training the amend ments should be eliminated. Senator Frellnghuysen said there should be no reduction in the size of the army when we know the forces that are working at this time in the country. He declared that one divi sion of approximately 27,500 men should be stationed in the vicinity of Washington. Senator Reed, Democrat, Missouri, wanted to know the reasons for this, and the New Jersey Senator called at- tentlon that 2,000 men had captured Petrograd and said that he believed the American capital should be pro tected at all times against any possible emergency. Senator Wadsworths motion to stHke out the provision providing for a reduction for five years of 2 per cent, of the commissioned and 5 per cent, annually of the enlisted person nel was adopted, 35 to 12 . Senator Reed, Missouri, moved to reconsider the vote. He declared that if the Army bill was approved it would cost every man, woman and child in the United Stated nearly 8 for the support of the army alone in 1921. A family of five persons, he said, will pay 40 for the land forces, not counting the stupendous naval appro priations proposed. I estimate that at the expenditures are authorized it will cost every family of five persons in the United States at least 150 for the military establishment in 1921. Senator Reeds motion to reconsider was defeated. The bill, which will be offered by Senator Chamberlain, Oregon, as an amendment to the pending Army Re organization bill, ould create a board of review in the Judge Advocate-Gen erals office with power, to modify or annul all court-martial sentences. Other Important modifications, rec emmended include Death sentences must be by a three-fourths Instead of a two- thirds vote of the courts. Courts must have members with legal experience and be composed of officers having at least two years service. Defendants may have counsel, military or civilian, of their own selection. Civil rules bf evidence shall apply and evidence gathered in prelimi nary ex-partre investigations shall not be admitted without consent of aficused. Verdicts of acquittal may not be set aside. Punishments may not be heavier than under civil procedure. Disciplinary punishments shall be preferred to courts-martial.

Hides, boots and iboes and leather were voted back to the tariff free list by the Senate, which thus concurred in action taken hy the House more than a year ago. There was only one roll callon hides _nd the result was 39 to 26 against the committee rates of two cents a pound on green or pickled and four cents on dried hides. Nineteen Republicans voted for a duty on hides and 23 against the duty, while seven Democrats voted for the duty and 16 against. Most of the more marked lines which have developed in the Senate during the tariff fight disappeared on this vote, but about the only surprise was that majority of the Republicans voted against making hides dutiable. There was a split even in the Fi nance Committee majority and in the Republican - agricultural - tariff bloc, which, through its chairman, had asked for two cents on green hides and six on dried hides. .- Only two members of the Finance Committee majority  Curtis and Smootsupported the duties, while four membersCalder, Dillingham. Frelinghuysen and Sutherlandvoted against them. Chairman McCumber and. Senator Watson, of Indiana, the other two members present, were paired. Five members of the tariff bloc broke away on the ballots. With hides sent back to the free list, Senator Smoot, of Utah, for the committee, moved that the Senate dis agreed to the amendment proposing a rate of 12 cents a pair and 5 per cent, ad valorem on boots and shoes and varying rates on band rough and aoie leather, belting and harness leather and various other kinds of this product. This motion prevailed with out a roll-call. In the six hours debate on the hide duty, Senator Lodge, of Massachus etts, the Republican leader, and Sen ator Walsh of the same State, a Demo cratic member of the Finance Com mittee, were found fighting side by aide against the duties. Senators Len- root, Republican, of Wisconsin, and Pomerene, Democrat, Ohio, also made extended arguments against removing hides from the free list, while Sena tors Bursum, Republican, of New Mex ico Jones, Democratof New Mexico McCumber, Republican, of North Da kota, in charge of the bill Sanfleld,j Republican, of Oregon, and Gooding! supported the committees recommen dation. There was a sharp disagreement be- 1 tween proponents and opponents as to  how much the proposed hide duties i would Increase the price of shooi and j as to whether the cattle raisers or the Chicago meat packers would get the benefit from the tariff. Opponents Placed the increase on shoes at from 20 cents a pair to 27 cents, while ad vocates said the increased cost would range from 3 to 6 cents a pair. Senator Lodge and Walsh declared the boot and shoemakers were opposed to duties on their products if they ould have free hides, because they j were competing in the world markets  nd needed no protection. They also j contended that the tariffs on hides I would injure if not destroy the 700 1 Independent tanning concerns in the j country who depended upon imported hides. Senator Lenroot argued that 90 per cent, of the farmers of the country j ouId lose by reason of a tariff on j hides, as they had only one or two i hides to sell a year, while they were  compelled to buy many pairs of shoes I tor their families."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["ould"], "snippet": "their products if they <mark>ould</mark> have free hides, because"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["ould"], "snippet": "their products if they <mark>ould</mark> have free hides, because"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
