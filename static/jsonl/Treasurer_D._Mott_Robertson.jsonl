You forfeit vour pou I s content, and for a tim ely gain you bar ter the iufinities.

We certainly claim and stand for a reduction in taxation and this can be accom plished by an honest and econom ical adm inis tration of the countys affairs, w ithout hurt or injury to schools or roads. W e are in favor of im proving the schools of the county and to this end we favor the elections by the people of School Superinten dents and Trustees.

Mott Robertson, late county- treasurer, who resigned that office last summer, has announced to sono of his friends that he will stand fo the Democratic nomination for tb clerkship, and that he will, if elect ed, run the office for the fees alone This would be a saving to the tax payers of nearly 600 per annum, or nearly 5,000 for th\u00e8 term.

Mr. J Rolfe Horsley, whom Mr. Peers de feated for the office in 1899, is also likely to be a candidate. Mr. Hors ley last Week resigned the position of private secretary to Congressman Flood, which oarried a salary of 1, 200 per annum paid by Congress and assumed the management of the Southside Virginian. The resigna tion of Mr. Horsley probably caused Dr. Robertsons early announcement of his candidacy. We are satisfied that there will be other candidates. The people are being quietly sounded as to thiB and that man, bat the great majority of them will hardly bind themselves to any one at this stage of the game- none, perhaps, except a few whc be lieve that they ought to be allowed  to shape all the public policies of the connty, and to name all of the officeholders years in advance of the election.

He complains about the debts we fowe for school buildings. The bool hoards of the County do owe ePLlterary Fund for money bor rowed to aid in building the Appo- mattox high school, the Stonewall high school, and the graded schools at Oakville, Tower Hill, Vera, and Pamplin, but they are paying what they owe as it falls due, and the in terest on what they owe, out of the school levy, and will continue to do so. We also owe the Literary Fund for part of the money necessary to build the dormitory at Appomattox but we borrowed tiffs money on 15 years time at 3 interest, and the small rental charged teachers t and scholars for rooms in this dormitory will pay the interest and retire the debt as jt matures. This is un doubtedly a good business proposi tion, but no sound business proposi tion ever penetrated the head of D. Mott Robertson. The Appomattox high school, in eluding grounds, building, and equipment, has cost not less than 30,000, over twice as much as the court-house and jail cost. The County of Appomattox has only subscribed 2,000 of this amount. The rest of it was given by the State subscribed by patriotic citizens, anc borrowed from the State. The original amount we borrowed to build this school was 7,500. The interest on this and 4,500 of the principal has been paid out of the school levy. Future interest and the other 3,000 will be paid in the same way. A safe business proposition oi! this kind in the interest of the children of Appomattox County does not appeal to D. Mott Robertson because he is opposed to the children of any part of the County havin the same advantages the children of other counties have at least, his letter justifies the conclusion that such is his opposition. We are for the schools, for good schools all over the County, and with the present rate of taxation, before many years roll around we will have good schools within the reach of every child in the County, . Dr. Robertson alludes with much bombast to the time when he was Treasurer, as if he ran the whole business. We know that the Boar of Supervisors to which he refers Messrs. Ligon, Thornhill, and Jones were .capable and honest officials and progressive men, and un doubtedly would have done more for the development of the County if Dr. Robertson had promptly paid over the taxes he collected.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J.

The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight.

To the Voters of Appomattox County The long communication of Dr. D. Mott Robertson, published in the T imes -V irginian of October 20th, and covering three columns, is so full of misrepresentations and false conclusions that we deem it neces sary in the interest of truth to reply to it. Dr. Robertson, towards the con elusion of his article, says Mr Good Citizen, if you believe that 1 havq shown wherein the Board of Supervisors has misrepresented the facts in their circular, I ask you to go to the polls on November the 2d and Cast your vote to rebuke such an administration.  This is a direct charge that our circular issued to the voters of Ap pomattox County contained mis representations. I f we have, let Mr Good Citizen vote against us. Ii Dr. Robertson has, let Mr. Good Citizen administer to the Doctor the medicine he has prescribed, and go to the polls on next Tuesday ant. vote against him and the ticket he has put in the field. First. The Robertson letter at tacks our statement in reference to the tax rate. We stated that the tax rate for County and State purposes in 1914 was the same that it was in 1901 when Dr. Robertson was Treasurer. We further stated that the rate for school purposes was 15c on the 100 worth of property in 1901 and 50c in 1914. Dr. Robertson claims that that statement is incorrect, and undertakes to mislead his readers by mixing the tax rate for school pur poses with that for Coupty purposes, when we have distinctly separatee the two. We thought even D. Mott Robert son could understand this distinc tion. We were aware of his habit of always muddling things and espe cially matters relating to finances and more especially when it was tc his interest to muddle them, but we did not see and do not now see, how he understood our circular as he pretends in his letter to have mis understood it. You will observe that iu his letter he fixes the rate of County taxation in 1901 at 80c. He embraces in this the 15c levied for school purposes. Deducting 15c from the 80c, leaves the tax rate for County purposes 65c. The rate of State taxation _ 1901 was 40c. Add 40c to 65c and it makes 1.05, which was levied ii 1901 for State and County purposes, outside of the County levy for school purposes. The rate of taxation ir 1914 outside of that levied for schoo. purposes is 70c, the State rate was 35c, making 1.05 for County and State purposes, outside of the County levy for school purposes. The two figures are exactly the samejust what we said in our circular. Now we 88k the people Who is undertaking to misrepresent the facts? Second. Dr. Robertson takes - sue with the Board in the wisdom of having built some improved roads with ffie aid, not only of the State, but of private subscriptions. He seems to think that it is both illegal and immoral to have done so. That such a course was legal is evidenced by the fact that it is approved by the laws of Virginia that it is perfectly moral is recognized by everybody but Dr. Robertson. The State of Virginia enacted some laws for the permanent im provement of roadb and bridges. Other laws provide that it would put up one-half of the money or a convict force for the building 0f these roads and bridges. The County of Appomattox at first accepted money, and, with the money gotten from the State and supplemented by just as much from the County treasury, built seven permanent bride As County at"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["D", "Mott", "Robertson"], "snippet": "long communication of Dr. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Mott</mark> <mark>Robertson</mark>, published in the T"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["D", "Mott", "Robertson"], "snippet": "long communication of Dr. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Mott</mark> <mark>Robertson</mark>, published in the T"}], "text_match": 2312642367913459833, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3319999365120", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "2312642367913459833", "tokens_matched": 4, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

In this article, Dr. Robertson, re ferring to the election in 1915 for the Treaanryahip of Appomattox connty, uses the following langnage Now, Mr. Voter, yon can see that we were defeated by this illegal act, logether with the illegal act of Mr. A. H How erton, who claimed that the law said the nnnsed ballots most be burnt. Read the law below and yon will see that the word burn does not occur save in the imagination of Mr. A. H How erton, who evidently wished to procure some ballots for some purpose known only to himself and his allies. Briefly stated, the facts, insofar as my connection with said election e concerned, are as follows I was one of the three judges of election at the precinct known as Oheatwood. When the p o l l s closed, I and the other judges pres ent were of the opinion that the unnaed ballots should be burnt. As matter of fact the statute do s not use the word burnt, hut uses the word destroyed. It is true that the ballots we-e not destroyed be fore the ballot-box was opened, be cause, being under the impression that they should be burned, it was thought wisest not to burn them on the inside of the old and dilapi dated house in which the election was being held. They were, how- ver, turned over to Mr. 8. P. Oole- man, jr , who in a short time there after, and on the outside of the house, burnt them, with two of the judges present witneeeing the burn mg. The failure of myself and the other judges to destroy these ballots before opening the ballot box bad absolutely no effect whatever upon the resalt of the election at that precinct, for the simple reason that not one of the an used ballots was ever used for any improper purpose, each and every one of them being destroyed. There were only two candidates for Treasurer, Mr. R. F. Burke,who was elected, and Dr. D. Mott Rob ertson, who was defeated. At m precinct of Oheatwood, Hr. Bnrke only received eight votes, which were counted for him, and I am hereto attaching the signed state ment of the eight men who vofed for him on that occasioo We, wnose names are signed to this pap -r, do certify that we voted for R. F. Bnrke for Treasurer of Appomattox Goan- tv, Virginia, in the General Election held in November, LSI 5, at Oheatwood precinot, Appomattox connty, Va. This September 19,1917.  Signed 8. P.
