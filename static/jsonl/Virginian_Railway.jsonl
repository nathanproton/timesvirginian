PAULETTE With so much thought and energy going into the Historic Appomattox Railroad Festival, a backward glance at the Depot seems in order. It was n the year of 1852 that the first railroad was built through the county of Appomattox. It was called the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad. The first passenger train went through Appomattox enroute tp Roanoke in November of 1852. At that time the engine was fired with wood the wood was cut, hauled, and stacked along side the tracks. Some time later the railroad was renamed The Virginian and Tennessee Railroad. Today it is the Norfolk and Western Railway System. In notes- belonging to Miss Nola Burkey, a- retired elementary school teacher, we find  the following. According to the late Nathaniel Gregory,-the first railroad station was just a boxcar. Some time later a station proper was built.

No Virginia far mer should be satisfied with less than six barrels per acre. Looking out over the fields of the Valley and the Pied mont country across the mountains at this season of the year it la hard to conceive that any- Virginia farmer houses so small a crop as thatand yet If the average of the state .shall be brought up to six barrels, on the basis of,last years acreage and the ten-year average farm price, approxi mately 96,900,000 a year would be add ed tt the Income of Virginia farmers- More Wheat Per Acre. Again An average production of 124 bushels of wheat per acre is not a record with which we can he satis fied when compared with 19 bushels for the United States, 29 bushels for Nevada, 26.5 for Washington and 25 for Maine. I know of an average Virginia farm on which a yield of 47 bushels per acre was made last year under normal conditions and treat ment and wherever that Is possible by the use-of Intelligence certainly we should not be satisfied with anything leas than an average of 20 bushels throughout the State. On the basis of last years acreage end the average farm price for ten years, a twenty bushel crop throughout the State would add nearly six million dollara to the value of the wheat crop of Vir ginia. More than half a million dollars would be added to the annual value of the oat crop by Increasing the aver age yield from 19.5 to 26 bushels per acre and the annual value of the po tato crop would he increased by more than 8700,000 by raising the average production per acre from 81 to 90 bushels. Are these figures to make any Vir ginian comfortably content with ex isting conditions? Manufacturing In Virginia- Turning now to our record of manufactures. In common with oth er leading Southern States Virginia has demonstrated her ability to com pete with the North In mannfao- tuririy. The last census of manufac tures shows that, as measured by the percentage of Increase in the value of products, the South, aa a whole, had gona forward in the five years from 1904 to 1909 faster than any other sec tion except some of the far Western States where the volume of business done was so small that a relatively slight growth In the value of products showed a large percentage of la- crease. The census of manufactures of 1909 showed that the total value of the products of Virginia factories In that year was 9219,794,000, an In crease in the five years of 47.7 per cent, as compared with an Increase for the United States ef 89.7 per cent Kentucky, with 8223,754,000, was the only State south of the Ohio and Poto mac Rivers that surpassed Virginia in the value of Its manufactured pro ducts. North Carolina, with 52 per cent, was the only Southern State with a higher rate of Increase. Yet, encouraging as these comparative fig ures may be, If we look Into details we can find a basis for that dissatis faction with things as they are which should spur us forward to larger ac complishments. Opportunities Are Abundant. The geographical location of Vir ginia is most favorable for a large de velopment of manufacturing. Among the factors that are potent in deter mining the location of industries are the sources of supply of raw mate rials, an available supply of compe tent labor, markets for finished pro ducts, and transportation facilities for concentrating raw materials and dis tributing finished products- Within the State of Virginia and In the states to the Southward are sources of sup ply of raw materials for a wide diver sity of manufacturing. To the north ward, across the Potomac -River, are the markets of the most densely popu lated region In the United States and outside of the Virginia Capes are the markets of the world- The railway lines of the State are admirably locat ed for the concentration of raw mate rials and for the distribution of manu factured commodities to all parts of the United States and we have direct water transportation not only to all tho oceans of the world, but also by way of the Atlantic Ocean and Chesa peake Bay to the seacoast elttes of the United States. For certain kinds of manufacturing we have a supply of white labor which has not yet been fully availed of. These are reasons why Virginia should play even a larg er part than she does In the manufac turing Industries of the South. Cotton Mills In Virginia. Chief among these Industries is one which every Southern man, and not least every Virginian, should regard with a thrill of pridefor the fact that supremacy in cotton manufactur ing In the United States has passed from the North to theSouth. For sev eral years Southern mills have con sumed more cotton than those In all the other States. In the eleven months ended June 30, 1915, Southern mills consumed 421,714 more bales than were used In all the other States and consumption in Southern mills increased 31,000 bales while In all oth er States It decreased 108,432 bales, With the Northern limit of the cot ton belt within her borders, Virginia lies In the direct line from the cotton fields to the domestic and foreign mar kets for cotton goods. Virginia has flourishing cotton manufacturing in dustry, which, in 1909, turned out pro ducts to the value of 37,933,000, an in crease in five years of 67 per cent. While this rate of Increase was large, the total volume of business done shows that this State has not yet made the most of her advantages for cotton manufacturing.
