But Zeb was gone. Oh. why tiki he go? Why did lie not wait Just a moment longer? She quickeucd h r pace and when she reached the top of the hill was almost out of breath. Zeb had gone out of sight down the mountain. She tried to call his name, but her utterance was only a whisper. But at last she managed to call Oh, Zeb!  The breeze blew the echo of her own tones back into her face. Tears gushed from her eyes, and she sunk down upon the roadside to sob away her sudden lieartsickhess. Tile clouds begun to gatlln nml at nfidnight the rain began to fail in tor rents. Uy dawn the waters of the Tuckasicge were high between its banks, and the boom-loggers were busy with their rafts, but Zeb Norton, their farmer foreman-, was not among them. Six years had slippel away. Nance Hooper still lived with her father in the cabin on the side of the mountain. She ktiJ! went outeach evening to call the lings at Ik head of the ravine, nml ii her heart she still lived the old love and deep Zeb Norton has never been heard or Sineo his, sudden disap pearance. Gold had been discovered on theiTuckasieBo, and. the. community was wild with excitement. But what saemfed unfortunate to the prospectors was that the rich vein had been dis covered ou a body of land belonging to one Zeb Norton, whose whereabouts were unknown. They feared to pro ceed with mining operations without having first having secured a lease of some kind, and since this could not he obtained from the owner the enterprise was at a standstill. Half a year passed by. One day n passenger stepped from the morning train which stopped at Dollsboro, niul stood with his hands rammed down into pockets. He was dressed in the style of a Westerner. A wide-brimmed sombrero rested on his head, nud a heavy brown mustache ornamented bis upper lip. For a moment he gazed all around him.  Its not exactly like it used to be. though it aint much changed, either. he muttered, as he picked up his valise and walked toward a little boarding house a few yards away. It was noon, nud Ihe traveler was hungry. Meet ing the landlady at Ihe entrance, he gave her a fitly-rent piece and asked 11 the way to the dining room. After dining the stranger spent sev eral hours in wandering about the vtl- ige. Late In the afternoon lie sus pended his valise on a stout staff which he rested on his shoulder and set off up the river road afoot. Ever and raon, as he tramped along the high way he would stop at some high point and gaze across the hills and valleys. Just like they used to he, all just the same, he would usually mutter as he turned away and continued his journey. At Inst he reached the highest point in the road where it turned dowu the mountain oh the other side of the river. Just the same, he said, theres not even a change in the road. Wonder if Mark Hooper lives there yet, lie contiued as lie,looked toward the cabin off to the right. A little farther aloug he turned away from the road and walked slowly dowu to where the fence crossed the ravine. Here he seated himself ou an old. fast- deeaying stump, allowiug the staff and valise to carelessly slip from his shoulders. Then, pushing his sombrero hack upon his head he locked his fingers across his knee and gazed away through the opening over the ravine. It was almost sundown and there were a few clouds in the sky. Just the same, he muttered again after a few monseuts silence every thing just like it was. I wonder if Nance did ----  He closed his lips tightly against further utterance. There seemed to be a sudden breaking loose of somethin which had been long tied up in hi breast. At last he arose, and, shoulderiuj his staff and valise, started back to the road. And just as he turned his bar toward the cabin Nance came out with her apron full of vegetables for the hogs, and came on slowly down the path toward the fence. The traveler, who had walked on without looking backward, had scarce ly disappeared beyond a turn in the road, when his ears caught the sounds  Pig-pig-pig-oo-eh. as Nance called the hogs. Again tlie staff and valise slipped from his shoulder, and, with his bands rammed down into his pockets, he listened, while his heart beat heavily against his breast. At last he turned about and slowly retraced his steps, leaving his bag gage, where it had fallen, in the middle of the road. He approached within a few feet of Nance before he stopped. Then, steadying his voice as well as he could, be called her name. Nance suddenly turned about gazed upon the tall form of the West erner. Then, barsting Into tears, she dropped her apron and impulsively sprang toward him.

A fresh cut j tree will not take fire any m ore  easily during the first day or two J than would the evergreen shrubs  growing outside but it becomes j a m ore serious fire hazard every hour. At the end of a week, it will be highly flammable. It is best to bring in a fresh tree as short a time before Christmas as possible, and to remove it as soon afterwards as you can. If you do this, ordinary precautions should prevent it from taking fire. Fami lies, clubs, churches and business men who want to keep their trees from a week or more before Christ mas until after New Years day need observe special safeguards to keep it reasonably safe. P lace in Pan of W ater. The tree can be kept fresh if you set it up in a pan of water. Cut off the base of the tree at an angle at least one inch above the original cut and keep it standing in water during the entire period that the tree is in the house, adding water to the jar or tub in which the tree stands at intervals to keep the wa ter level always above the cut. This methed when used with fresh trees reduces the flammability as effec tively as any fireproofing chemicals. Chemicals may cause the tree to turn brown or yellow or to lose its needles. The place you select for your tree should be well away from stoves, ra diators, and other sources of heat. The tree should be well secured against falling by inconspicuous wires holding it against the wall. The tree should be so placed that standing qr fallen, it cannot block a doorway which might be needed to escape from the room. Candle Still Takes Toll. The candle for Christmas is still taking its yearly toll of lives and property. It is found on Christmas trees more rarely every year, but none the less, it is used unwisely in many places during the Christmas n . j  season.

Mrs. Davies consumed a great deal of time in selecting a chocolate, but she did not sit down.  Shall you be at liberty this evening. Gail? she inquired, with much care lessness. Why? and Gail, whose feet were stretched out and crossed, in lazy ease, looked up at her sunt sidewise from under her curving lashes. Mrs. Davies hesitated a moment. Houston Van Ploon would like t 1 call. Are they still downstairs?. Gail suddenly unveiled her eyes, and brought her slippers squarely in front of her divan. Also she sat bolt up right. Yes, and Mrs. Dayies betrayed signs of nervousness, Are they making the appointment forH ouston? Yes. The word drawled. Why? and Gails brown eyes be gan to crackle. Mrs. Davies thought it better to sit down. My dear, a great honor has come to you.. . . Gail leaned forward towards her aunt, and tilted her chin. Houston wants to propose, and hes sent his father and sister to find out if he may! she charged. Yes, acknowledged Mrs. Davies, driven past the possibility of delay or preparation, and feeling herself unjust ly on the defensive. I shall not be at home this eve ning. announced Gall decisively, and stretched out her feet again, and crossed her little gray slippers, and took a chocolate. Or any other eve ning, she added. Mrs. Davies lost her flutter imme diately. This was too stupendously serious a matter to be weakly treated. My dear, you dont understand! she protested, not in anger, but In pa tient reason. Houston Van Ploon has been the unattainable match of New York. He is a gentleman in every par ticular, a desirable young man in every respect, and gifted with everything a young girl would want He has so much money that you could buy a kingdom and be a queen, if you chose to amuse yourself that way. He has a dignified old family, which makes mere social position seem like an ignomini ous scramble for cotillion favors and it is universally admitted that he is the most perfect of all the Van Ploons for many generations. Not exception ally clever but that Is one of the rea sons the Van Ploons are so particular to find a suitable matrimonial alliance for him. Gail, nibbling daintily at her choco late, closed her eyelids for a second, the long, brown lashes curved down on her cheeks, and from beneath them there escaped a sparkle like the snap of live coals, while the corners of her lips twitched in that little smile which she kept for her own enjoyment.. You cannot appreciate the compli ment which has been paid you, Gail. Every debutante for the past five years has been most carefully consid ered by the Van Ploons, and I sincere ly believe this to be the first time they have unanimonsly agreed on a choice. It is a matter of eugenics, Gail, but in addition to that, Mr. Van Ploon assures me that Houston is most fer vently interested. How careless of them, criticized Gail. They have neither asked for my measurements nor examined my teeth. Gail! Her chaperon and sponsor was both shocked and stern. I positively decline to even discuss the Van Ploon eugenics, stated Gail, pushing aside her chocolates, while a red spot began to appear on her cheeks. I shall not, as I stated be fore, be at home to Houston Van Ploon this eveningor any other evening. I shall not deliver that message, announced Mrs. Davies, setting her lips. As your present sponsor, I shall insist that you take more time to con sider a matter so important. I shall insist on refusing to con sider it for one second, returned Gail quietly. I am very fond of Houston Van Ploon, and I hope to remain so. but I wouldnt marry him under any circumstances. This is firm, flat, and final. Mrs. Helen Davies dropped patient reason instantly. She was aware of an impulsive wish that Gail were in pinafores, and her own child, so she could box her ears, Gail, you compel me to lose my pa tience! she declared. When you came, I strained every influence 1 possessed to have you meet the most desirable eligibles this big city could offer, just as if you were my own daughter!

Through all his great success, due so largely to that wonderful violin, there had been the skeleton at the feast, and nowthe doctor was dead and his daughter unprovided for, living, it seemed, on charity. . M. DrascovyMiss Manfield ,1 said Mrs. Vincent. She saw a tall, queenly woman, with lustrous brown eyes and bright, fair hair, dressed in a deep black gown, relieved by the least touch of white about the throat. Her move ments were slow and very graceful, and when she spoke it was in a low voice full of melody. She was very beantif nl. He conld hardly take his eyes off her, and yet, if she happened te look toward him, he started and cast down his eyes. He conld not sleep that night. He knew there was only one woman in the world for him and shewas the daughter of the man he had robbed! It was well,or ill, for him that he conld not see her next day, sitting by a conch on which a sick man lay, one hand in his, the other stroking his hair. Patience, dear heart, patience, she whispered, things will be better soon. I shall get introductions and pupils through Mrs. Vincent, and then, dear, it will be all right. You mast be content to wait till then, for you know I shall he always true and loving. .

Anti now I will read to you, or we will talk together. And so the brave, strong woman helped the man she had loved so long and still lovedven now that he was condemned to lie on a conch for his lifetime through an accident in a London street. He was poor, and so was she. The working and waiting would perse vere and conquer. Drascovy was often to be found at Mrs. Vincenti honse daring the next fortnight, anc one afternoon, to his great delight, he found Mrs. Vincent out and Miss Manfield alone in the drawing room. Ten minntes later he had told her he loved herhad asked her to be his wife. She bid her face in her hands and bade him be silent. You do not understand how shonld yon? she said.

Clarksburg, W. Va., has l confessed robbing a Japanese bank  of 580,000 yen about 38,800 while ! posing as an army bank examiner, 8 th army headquarters announced. The lP vear-old marine is being held here on a larceny charge after he confessed that he planned and conducted the daringly simple theft entirely by himself. His signed confession was taken by criminal investigation division investigators under Capt. Otis J. Carter, Los Angeles, C.alif., who said Brown carried forged papers that enabled him to convince of ficials of the Totsuka branch of the Yokohama-Koshin bank that he was a bank examiner. The confession stated that Brown made a survey of the bank on March 12 and the following day returned and told the bank manager his funds would have to be transferred to Tokyo. The manager placed the 580,000 yen in bags, and Brown, accom panied by four bank clerks who were acting as guards, left for Yokohama by train. At Yokohama they all got off the train and Brown took the mony, got in a waiting truck and drove off, saying he would be back in a few minutes.

Finally the conclusion was reached that Sarah Browning Taylors illness was aborted crib death. She had been striken with crib death, known as the silent killer of infants, and when her mother picked her up the crib death was aborted or in terrupted. It is believed that, had her mother been only one- half minute late in picking up her daughter, the baby would have been dead. From May 31 until July 1, Sarah was dependent on a respirator. There were brief periods when she could breathe without it but not for long she would be dependent on the machine again to keep her alive. It was on June 1 that Sarah was flown by private plane to the Virginia Baptist Hospital in Lynchburg. Before leaving Charleston, the doctors gave the parents and grandparents no hope but Urn Taylors did not share the opinion of the doctors. Looking at Sarah with her beautiful brown eyes and brown hair that has a promise of red highlights, the Taylors love her deeply and have committed her to Gods care and have never stopped hoping. Already walking closely with their Lord the Taylors are aware of a deepening of their faith each day since the onset of Sarahs illness. When Sarah was permitted to leave the hospital, the Taylors were unable to decide whether to take their daughter to their home in Forest or to come to Appomattox County in order to be with his parents. The doctors made the decision for them. Sarah must be kept near the hospital. Sometime earlier Rev. and Mrs. Taylor had purchased a nome in Lynchburg with the idea of retiring there some day  it just so happened that at the time Sarah was leaving the hospital the house was empty. Since the doctors advised the Taylors to have two people with Sarah at all times, Jeff and Debbie moved into this fathers house in Lynchburg and to help them out Rev. and Mrs. Taylor moved from Appomattox Coun ty to the Lynchburg house, also.

Collins worked himself free and tried to help the girl through the throng. He reached her and offered her his arm. She declined it indig nantly, and Collins, crestfallen, fol lowed her to the car door, where he was at once seized by a gray-coated Subway guard. Hold him! yelled the puffy-faced man, who, hatless and coatless, now appeared on the scene.
