Jones and John Overton as clerks. After nine votes had been regularly polled, negro named Henry Hughes weut into the booth to get Constable Mar tin to fix his ticket. Mr. Martin told him he would assist him by pointing ont the names to him. Thi Mr. Martin d id and poiu ted c u tTren tl name and Floods name both of which he scratched and then pointed out Smiths name which he scratche when the negro stopped and said You have scratched Mr. Colli us name, the very man 1 wanted vote for. The constable replied, You are a d ----- -n liar  if you dont like that ticket get anothe one and fix it to suit yourself. The negro then folded the ticket up and without makiug the slightest com plaint voted it. He weut out and iu about ten minutes Mr. E. F.
