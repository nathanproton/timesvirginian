We need time to grow and we will have to play one gameat a time Cox is fortunate that the Genrals do not open when all the other teams in the district see action Friday night. William Campbell has an open date for the first week of the season, which will allow them another week of preparation before they meet Appomattox in its season opener.

His most recent coaching duties saw him as an assistant if they are to be successful in a quest for a Seminole District title. Cox will probably have the Generals in a split T offense with either Allen Harper of Kip Burch at quarterback and -William Mitchell and Alvin Younger at running back, i Other candidates for the running back post are Mike M arstin, Ronnie Chambers, Cornelius Adam?

The convention opened with a kejr- aote speech which Ufta Temporary Chairman Glynn into the ranks of the foremost orators of the country. It had everything to make It a historic utterance. In thought It fitted into the needs of the hour It presented the Issues as they are now before the American people. The Republican platform cslttdem of the presidents foreign policy fur nished the speaker a text, although the numerous cases with which he Illus trated his line of thought showed extended research. He defended the presidents coarse In the maintenance of neutrality by an overwhelming ar ray of facts and precedents. He called as witnesses all of the prominent Re publican officials and all the great presidents he showed how, from Washington down, the nations most illustrious executives have dealt as President WMson lias with violations of our nations rights. He showed how nearly all of the great nations of Europe have at times Interfered with our shipping, attacked eur war vessels, killed oar officials and Invaded our country and how, Instead of set tling our grievances by war, we had settled them by negotiation, Just aS the president of the United States IS trying to do today. pikes Q. O. P. Dun. He piled up precedent upon prec edent end cited the course pursued by president after president. The con cluding phrase, just as the president ef the United States Is doing today, appealed to the audience with Increas ing force and It le sure to become one of the popular phrases of the cann palm. He has spiked one of the Mg guns of the enemy. When his speech has been read throughout the country, aS It will be, the Democratic speakers will have aU the authority they need for the silencing of Republican criti cism. To make a Republican orator ridiculous It will only be necessary to draw ex-Governor Glynns speech upon him and ask him how Grant settled the Virginias case when a Spanish commandant shot the captain, thirty- six of the crew and sixteen of the pas sengers  how Harrison settled the Bal timore case when a Junior officer waS killed and sixteen sailors wounded lu the streets of Valparaiso how Lincoln settled the burning of SL Albans how1 the Alabama claims were settled how Van Boren settled the Carolina case how John Adams treated the 2,800 vio lations of the neutrality law by France how Washington dealt with the 400 cases where France and Eng land seized our ships. In all these cases, the answer Is that the presidents then ln office did not go to war they settled them by negotiations, jiust as the president of the United States la trying to do to day. Covers All Important Issues. While tlie chief merit of Governor Glynns speech lies in the unanswer able argument advanced ln support of the presidents position on neutrality, It covered all Important Issues in volved ln this campaign. It enumerat ed the remedial measures enacted dur ing the past three years, Including tariff legislation, antitrust legislation, and currency reform, and it did not omit preparedness. It Is a compen dium of Information and argument and will ln Itself supply sufficient ma terial for campaign speakers through out the country. It began with Ameri canism and ended ln a eulogy of the president All ln all. It was an epoch- making speech and satisfied the audi ence as convention audiences are sel dom satisfied. It measured up to the highest requirements of the occasion It captivated the convention. It was as perfect from the stand point of rhetoric as It was complete from the standpoint of argument The arrangement was artistic the sen tences were all well balanced the pe riods were rounded.

Adam was cut off in other words not only from God but from himself, his best self. Further, he was cut off from his wife. The story of Genesis tells of the joyful words of welcome when Adam sees Eve for the first time. Paradise, for both of them, is complete only when the other one, the loved one, is there to share it. Now all is changed. Adams only w o r d about his wife isThe woman Thou gavest me, she gave me the fruit . .. Its all Gods fault for sending Eve, or its all Eves fault for tempting him, it couldnt be his own fault, oh no! When you get to the point where you wont take responsi- bibty for your own acts, when you blame everyone but your self for your sins and y o u r troubles, then you have really broken off relations with th e human race. The Solemn Question The first question God asks of man rings like a solemn want ing bell in the heart of every one some time or other. Where are you? You are here now, at this moment but you a r e wherever you act, you a r e wherever things happen  oi fail to happen  because of you. Someone perhaps m i g h t have believed in God if it had not been for you. You are there in that persons despairing cyni cal mind. Where are you? Re sults of what you say, what you do never stop with the saying and doing. Like stones thrown into a pond they create ripples that spread to distant shores. If an old man could realize all the evil that he caused during his lifetime, the burden of it would be overpowering. Yet there is another and a happier side. Gods question, Where are you? reminds us that God does care what we do. He does not easily give up, He seeks men in their dark hiding places. If He de mands obedience and punishes suffering, and He does, it is a sign of hope for it shows that God takes human lives serious ly He is not content to let men go.
