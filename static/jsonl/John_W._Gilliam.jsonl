The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Aroused by the childs screams, Mrs. Armel rushed into the room and rescued her daughter, after which the flames were extinguished. Mrs. Arme then fainted. The entire plant of the Vienna Bak- ery, Winchester, was destroyed by fire at an early hour the other moning, causjng a loss of several thousand dollars, partly covered by insurance. While running to the fire one of the Sarah Zane Fire Companys horses fell over a - pile of stone in the dark and was severely in jured. Mrs. Virginia Bond, widow of Thoma Bond, died at her home near Oronage Courthouse, aged 62 years. She is sur vived by two, sons and two sisters. The portrait of George Washington, owned in Fredericksburg by Masoni Lodge No. 4, which made him a Mason, has been pronounced by experts in Wash ington a genuine Gilbert Stuart paint ing. As Stuarts works are rare, this j original portrait is of considerable value. This is said to have been painted from life during Washingtons second term as President of the United States. Tra dition says it was a gift of Washington to his mother lodge. A young daughter of Mr. Amos Sulli van, of Stafford county, was badly burn ed last week by falling into an open fire. There was indignation in Norfolk on the receipt of the Congressional Record, which declares that the item in the River and Harbor bill as passed au thorizes a 25 and 30-foot channel to the navy yard in the Elizabeth river when the bill was drawn for a 30 and 35-foot channel. The channel is already 28 feet deep and vessels of 30-foot draft have passed out. If the item in the Congres sional Record be not a misprint the bill must have been tampered with. Phila delphia interests are suspected here. Benjamin Lovitt, a negro boy, was arraigned in Berkley, charged itith the malicious wounding of John Allen, son of D. V. Allen. Allen and other white boys were playing marbles when the negro boys approached and a quarrel en sued. Allen was stabbed in the back with a pocketknife. The wound is seri ous, and Lovitt is held to await the re- sult. The explosion of a bottle of nitre in the drug , store of Jerome P. Carr, of Portsmouth, set the place on fire. Mr. Carr failed to extinguished the blaze with a carbonater and called the Fire Depart ment. The stock and building are dam aged 1,000. Governor Montague has finally deter mined not to interfere jn the case oi Peter Dancy, the negro who was recently convicted of murder in the Circuit Court of Henrico county. Daney is sentenced ,to be hanged this Thursday. The State. Schoool Board, in its re port, vindicates Principal J. V. Hill, oi the Radford School, who had trouble of a personal nature some time ago with Superintendent of Schools Lucas. It is said that Radford will be merged with Montgomery county when the board meets in May to select superintendents. Dr. William W. Smith, chancellor of the Randolph-Macon System of Col leges, purposes to enlarge the Womans College at Lynchburg. He wants to raise 40,000 by subscriptions if the City Coun cil of Lynchburg will appropriate 10,- 000 to make the amount 50,000. Dr. Smith offers to erect during this year a science hall, costing 20,000, and an addi tional dormitory, which will aid him in increasing the attendance by too young ladies, if the city will make the asked for appropriation. This will bring the enrollment up to 550. Four prisoners escaped from the Lex ington Jail. They are John H. Maz- ingo, sentenced to four years in the pen itentiary for house-breaking S. C. Van landingham, sentenced to 12 months in jail for selling liquor in a local-option district, and Jack Lamb and Wade Gra ham, awaiting trial for house-breaking. The prisoners secured braces from their iron bedsteads and pried several bar from the bottom of the iron door. Crawling under the iron door, they used the bars as levers with which they pried open the outer wooden door leading into the hallway. They then pried the lock from the back door and escaped through the back yard. Apparently of its own accord a Southern railway passenger engine pulled out of the yards at Bristol and ran more than a mile down the Southerns main line, where it was found standing. Had it proceeded it would soon have collided with a freight train. All stations along the road were telegraphed to give warn ing of the runaway. Six unoccupied three-story houses at the corner of Virginia avenue and Twenty-eighth street, Newport News, were destroyed by fire. The buildings were owned by D. S. Jones and were valued, at ..about 5,000. When the Twenty-eighth street overhead bridge was erected its retaining wall was placed directly against the front porches of the tenements. Mr. Jones had sued the city to recover damages alleged to have been done by the wall. President W. M. Page, of the new Tidewater railway, which is to parallel the Norfolk and Western from Nor folk to the mountains, advertised for bids for the grading and masonry of 20 sectibris of the road, a distance of 100 miles west from Sewalls Point through Norfolk. He says the money is ready, and as soon as the bjds are accepted the work will begin. There is still some threat of opposition to the action of the city of Norfolk, even though the 95,000 that the Council appropriated for the right of way is at the call of the railway company. The Lynchburg Board of Trade and the Retail Merchants Association adopt ed separate resolutions calling upon the State Corporation Commission to defeat the effort to require the Southern and Norfolk and Western Railways to make connection at Burkeville if it will in any way manner be the cause of altering 1 he present schedules on the main line I of the Norfolk and Western."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["John", "Gilliam"], "snippet": "<mark>John</mark> <mark>Gilliam</mark>, colored, was sent to"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["John", "Gilliam"], "snippet": "<mark>John</mark> <mark>Gilliam</mark>, colored, was sent to"}], "text_match": 1733921019837546617, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2216192835584", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1733921019837546617", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
