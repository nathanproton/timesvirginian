Surry Nuclear Power Station accounted for more than 25 per cent of the electricity generat ed by Vepco during the first seven months, just as projected in 1970, Mr. Ragone said. If we had had two fossil fuel plants at Surry instead of nuclear during that same period, the fuel cost would have been about 70 million. Allow ing for the higher initial costs of  nuclear facilities and the cost of operation, the net effect is a reduction in cost per kilowatt- hour of 2.5 mills or a quarter of a cent. The amount of oil required for two fossil fuel units at Surrey would have been tre mendous. Comparable oil - fired units would have consumed about seven millions barrels, or about 294 million gallons, to produce the same amount of energy generated by the two nuclear units. Mr. Ragone pointed out that during each month of the second quarter of 1974 Sury Unit 1 produced more electrici ty than any other nuclear unit in the world. Fuel costs will be reduced even more, Mr. Ragone said, as the units mature and account for an even greater output of kilowatthours. During July arid August, TJnit 1 at Surry recorded a 74.6 per cent performance level. Surry 2 during those two months performed at 68.4 per cent. The national average of performance by all nuclear units for the first six months was 53.7 per cent. Surry at 50.9 per cent was slightly below the national average for the same period. However, six month comparisons are not very significant, Mr. Ragone warn ed.

Another utility, one in Florida, perhaps, would schedule a maintenance outage of its unit in the Summer because its Winter load is heavier. The economic benefits of nuclear power to the consumer have grown rapidly, Mr. Ragone said, since we decided in the sixties to add nuclear powr to our generation mix. In 1973, for example, fossil fuels cost two to three times as much as nuclear to generate one kilowatt hour. The cost was  less than three-tenths of a cent for nuclear, six-tenths of a cent for oil, and seven-tenths of a cent for coal at all stations except Mt. Storm, W. Va. Because of the rapid in crease in cost for coal and oil during the past 12 months, fossil fuels now cost five to six times the cost of nuclear to generate a kilowatthour. Dur ing July of this year, the average cost of fuel per kilowatthour generated was less than three-tenths of a cent for nuclear. Nuclear generating stations initially cost more than conven tional fossil fuel stations, but the long-term economic benefit is most apparent because nuclear fuel costs are substanti ally less than fossil fuel costs. Vepco told the Atomic Energy Commission in a letter dated May 6 , 1974, that The conclusion that nuclear is the most economical alternative is still a valid conclusion in todays business environment. New water and air quality control guidelines proposed by the Environmental Protection Ag ency would bring the costs of fossil fuel power stations even more in line with the cost of nuclear facilities. Mr. Ragone also said that with North Anna Nuclear Units 1 and 2 in service for 1977, along with Surry 1 and 2, fossil fuel savings will amount to at least 200 million annually even after the increased investment is taken into consideration. These four units will relieve the nation of the need for more than 50 million barrels of oil or about 13 million tons of coal annually."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Vepco"], "snippet": "than fossil fuel costs. <mark>Vepco</mark> told the Atomic Energy"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Vepco"], "snippet": "than fossil fuel costs. <mark>Vepco</mark> told the Atomic Energy"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

This will require installation of a special meter that registers the time of use, the customers peak demand, and the number of kilowatt- hours used. The key to saving on monthly bills depends on how much the customer can shift his use of electricity from on-peak, and more expensive hours, to the off-peak hours, said Mr. Berry. The second plan involves one thousand volunteers having electric water heaters. A special time-controlled meter that restricts operation of the water heater to off-peak periods will be installed.  This plan is recommended for customers whose electric water heaters have a large storage capacity and especially for those who have, a separate meter base on their homes from the previous special water heater rates.
