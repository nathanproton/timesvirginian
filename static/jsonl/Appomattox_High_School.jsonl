We realize that though the walk is finished some of the most important work - collecting pledges - remains to be done. We urge all of you who walked to collect your pledges and to turn them in as soon as possible. Pledge money may be turned in at the Appomattox County Extension Office, Appomattox Element ary School, Appomattox Ele mentary School, Appomattox Middle School, Pamplin Ele na entary and in the MD box in the office of Appomattox High School. We were happy to have Mr. Norman King, Richmond area Director for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, taking part in the walk. Mr. King completed the entire walk. Once all the pledges have been collected we will announce the winner of the bicycle which will be awarded to the person turning in the most pledge money. Were sorry that we didnt have pictures of the walkathon in progress. Howev er, we did get several right after the walkathon of some of the 200 people that walked. All funds raised in the Walkathon will be given to the Muscular Dystrophy Associa tion to provide for research and service programs provided by the Association. Again, many thanks are extended to the I people walking in the eqent, th o s e a s s is tin g w ith th e Walkathon and those of -you who pledged money to the walkers. We also wish to especially thank the Pepsi Cola Company from Lynchburg, Virginia for providing a concession stand of Pepsis and Dr. Peppers for the walkers at the end of the route. We appreciate their coopera tion and help with this worthy cause. Note also goes to Kings Markets for providing all ice used in providing the refresh ment stands along the route.
