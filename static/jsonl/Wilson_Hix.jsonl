They never dreamed that the Tavern they built at Clover Hill, in 1819, would become the museum of relics of a great peace for a nation re united after four years of bitter internacine war. Clover Hill Tavern is the oldest building at the Appomattox Court House National Military Park. It has just been restored and houses the National Park Service Museum . . . a museum now displaying as a late addition the famous Guillaume paint ing of the Surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee to Gen. U. S. Grant, April 7, 1865. Another new feature is an electric map, showing just where the great events of history occured here. Two brothers, Alexander and Lil bourne Patteson, opened a stage coach line from Lynchburg to Rich mond in 1811. At that time the im mediate area at what is now Old Appomattox Court House was a part of Prince Edward County, Appomat tox County not having been estab lished until 1845. In 1814 the Pat teson brothers purchased 206 acres laying near the north branch of the Appomattox River from one John B. Sadler. The land was valued at 157.89. In 1819 they built the Clover Hill Tavern, and the property zoomed to a value of 7,890. There is quite a story about these Patteson -brothers. A 208 page In formal History of the Virginia-Ken- tucky Pattesong in Illinois, Their Forbears and Their Kin by Ethel Marion Smith, traces the Patteson ancestry back to 1680. The first Pat teson entry in St. Peters Parish Reg ister in Eastern Virginia, shows that one Thomas Patteson came over from England in 1680 and settled on what is known as Roxbury Plan tation. Thomas Patteson had five sons Thomas, Edward, David, Alex ander and Geofrge, The next name to look for was Obfcdiah Patteson, who the St. Peters Parish Register says was born in 1750. His second son was named Littleberry . . . and father and son, Obediah and Little- berry took up land patents in this section in 1782. Records exist that show! that Obediah Patteson paid taxes on 800 acres of land in Camp bell County from 1782 through 1791. Littleberry Patteson was born in New Kent County in February, 1754, married in 1782 and died June 23, 1827. He fought in the Revo lutionary War. He is known to have paid taxes on land in Buckingham County from 1793 to 1814. He married Matilda Smith. Lilbourne and Alexander, build ers of Clover Hill Tavern, were sons of Littleberry Patteson. They owned Clover Hill Plantation, under a deed dated November 25, 1814. Alexander Patteson died in 1836, and his fam ily moved to Kentucky. Family rec ords show that the family was prom- ient. David Patteson of Chesterfield, Jonathan of Lunenburg, and Charles of Buckingham represented their re spective counties in the Virginia Convention of 1788 to ratify the United States Constitution. A stage coach line was a great thing 150 years ago. Clover Hill Tavern was a grand conception at a time when Americans were fan ning out from the Atlantic Coast and moving Westward. The Clover Hill Tavern remained in the hands of the Patteson family until Aug ust 8, 1839, when it passed to John Raine. It was transferred to Hugh Raine in 1842 for the sum of 3,- 200, and again passed to Samuel McDearmon in 1845. McDearmon, a great leader in the early growth of this section and one of the top citizens of his time, added many outbuildings and improvements to the Tavern. However, he sold the property to Samuel Glover in 1854. The foundation lines of this store are today readily apparent as a de pression in the ground between the Tavern and the Ferguson home, re cently used as Park Service office. About the year 1859, Glover transferred his holdings to Wilson Hix. The holdings at that time con sisted of lots 16 and 17 in the vil lage of Appomattox Court House and contained the Tavern and its outbuildings. Hix operated the prop erty as a hotel all through the Civil War period. It was yvritten up in the New York Hearld in April, 1865. It was referred to as Glenns Hotel and was used as the office of the paroling officer. Gen. Sharpe. In 1880, it was transferred from the estate of Wilson Hix to Edward G. Hix and included lots 11, 17, 18 and part of lot 16 in the village.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.
