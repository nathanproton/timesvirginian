One of these stops was at the Court House. During he year 1851 or 1852, the Atlantic, Mississippi  Ohio Railroad vas constructed through the County. The first passenger train roing through to Roanoke was in November, 1852. This, of ourse, was a great boon to the transportation and development lf the County. At that time the engines were fired with wood cut, hauled and stacked along the track. I The New Constitution above referred to, provided for the election of officers by a vote of the people, rather than by ap- Pointment, and in May of that year the first election was held.  1 I860 Geo. T. Peers became the County Clerk, Wilson BHix, Sheriff, Samuel J. Walker Commissioner of the Revenue, l and L. D. Isbell, Commonwealth Attorney. It was a time marked by great national issues and fateful  visions. Two conceptions of Government were clashing, one, the South adhered to States Rights, and followed the poli-  ical philosophy of Thomas Jefferson the otherthe North,  avored Centralized Government, and adopted the principles  f Government of Alexander Hamilton. Questions of Slavery  States Rights were major topics.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Going back to the old faipiljes, 1 recall the Adams familythe indus trious father and good Christian mother of Duval, Holcombe and Dick, and of Mrs. John W. Carroll, Mrs. Adams was a sister of the late Governor Duval of Florida, who pent much of the latier part of his d Miss Jennie was terribly afraid  jjfg aj. ber home near the old Court-  ! lightning. She occupied a short j douge writing a history of. Florida, sura with Isbell. At a loud clap of l djed before completing it, Some thunder and a vivid flash of lightn-, y6ars ag 0 j wrote a little piece about Dig, she involuntarily sprang nearer Lj,js most remarkable aud adventur- tu Isbell, wheu with his character -1 uj 0 jd governor, which the News i t ic humor he said, Set up close!  stick close to me, Miss Jennie,! Im the best lightning rod you! ever saw. Isbell went West and! I do not know if he is living  if so he is it is ou  borrowed i time, long past his three score and j leu. How well 1 recall his paro dies. One lie often repeated to the j girie- The girls are all deceitful show For mans deception given, Their s-iniles of joy and tears of woe. Deceitful shine, deceitful flow, Tljeie aint one true in Teven. BUCK TRENTS ANSWER. What would Appomattox be with out Buck Trent? Genial, jolly, fat Duck Trent. i liaye already alluded to the bos pitalityof Major West and his in- aristocratic tace terrestiug family, yet 1 must recur to it aguiu. 1 am debtor for some oi the happiest hours of my life to those good people. They hau then four grown daughters,, aud with liieLr numerous pretty cousiuE who visited the place, twas of course the reso t of we youug meu. It was approached by two roads meeting at right angles at the horse rack. How ofteu as Jim Robertson and myself would strike the clearing on one road, would we see Dauiel Isbell, Buck Trent and Crawford Jones approacuing on the other, when we would all dismount in a group at the gate.. On one occasion Christmas night the Major gave an oyster supper. Among the guests were the old people of the neighborhood m the private part of the mansion and enough of us younger ones to nearly fill the parlor. As the wee sma hours of the night approached, the older people came into the parlor as they dotted their wraps for the night ride home. For a moment there was a scarcity of seats, and while the small butler, Archer was bring ing in chairs, the old Major thought to fill in the time with a little trick for the boys. His plan was to place a lighted candle on the table, blind fold a boy, make him turn three times and approach the candle to blow it out. Bob West was a very bashful boy. He had a hen-house and was fond of chickens, and had been after his father fora few pul lets he had bought for the table. To induce him to try the candle the Major said, Come, Bob, if you will blow it out 111 give you two of my pullets. Buck Trent, who had 1 . ig had a weakness for one of the Majors pretty daughters, jumped up, and with that brass that only Buck could show, said, Major, if youll just give me one of your pul- lets Ill blow it out. Of course the room roared, and the Major had to give attention to Archer and the chairs. A little northwest of the Court house lived Dr. Palmer, au educated, refined, accomplished old Virginian gentleman. Like Doc Sifeis, he tramped tnose roads and forded those streamsor swum umfor two generations. I cau remember when he kept three horsfts, aud kept them all busy, too. He must have bad an iron constitution. His practice em braced Appomattox, a portion of Campbell and Buckingham and of ten over into Amherst. Who can tell the joy of the grieved mother and anxious father as they watched the fevered brow of u loved child, to see the Dr. ride up .on old Lion"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Isbell", "l"], "snippet": "of.
