The first two were very successful. The last one was not thoroughly carried out. We believe the main reason for this was lack of understanding of what was expected. It was a combi nation dim-out and- blackout. We know, of course, that there were no intentional violations of the rules governing these tests. In either a dim-out or a black out, no lights should be seen from the streets. In a blackout, all people must be in their homes, or at least off the streets except those assist ing in the blackout. The only differ ence between a.dim-out and a black out, is that people may be on the streets during a dim-out, and traffic may continue as usual, with hooded lights. However, during a blackout, all citizens are supposed to be off the strets and all traffic slopped. In the event that you attempt, to us blackout shades br curtains, be sure to test them out a night or two b. forehand, to be certain that no light shines through or by your shades. Ordinary window shades do not blackout. No light, regardless of its color, should be visiblefrom the outside. Flashlights, lighted cigars or cigarettes or matches are prohibit ed. Civilian defense officers on duty during the blackout must guard against striking matches or smoking. In he past, the auxiliary police have called the peoples attention to any violation of the.rules, explaining the violation to them and asking.that it not be repeated. In the future, the o.ice will give no further warnings r.nd no explanations to any of us. It is felt by the State authorities that all of us have had sufficient expla nation and instructions regarding the regulations, and we should govern ourselves accordingly. We are in structed to say further that if any one is found in violation of any of the regulations governing dim-outs or black-outs, that person will auto matically and promptly be summons ed to the mayors court of the town of Appomattox.

Another suggestion is to do away with a town treasurer and have the sergeant to do tho work alohg with that of his own office. The charter says there must be a treasurer, but it does - not say that the sergeant may not be trea surer. The combination would sive them 800 a year to the town and in the management ol ones private business that amount saved would be reckoned as desirable. Still another suggestion is that a general manager be appointed to have charge of the street improve ments, the electric light system and the water and sewer should the town buy the last two. What work has heretofore been done by members of the oonncil, principally by chair men of certain committees who serve without compensation and ii is urged that this is requiring too much of business men. i The town is waking up on ail lines rave on the advertising line. We are n.t letting the outside world hear about ns, and this in my opinion, is of prime importance. Larger cities are advertising as never before in their histories, and if it is necessary with them places like Farmville can not afford to neglect if. Atlanta has been made on printers ink, and Jacksonville is feeding at th-j same trough. Des . inoines perhaps leads them all and results ts-ere have been far ahead of all exp ctations. And whats true of towns and cities is equally true of merchants. Wanamaker is now 72 and yet he advertises as though he was beginning a new business for he has new goods to sell day by day. There are no shop-worn goods on the shelves of merchants who advertise. Not spasmodically but regularly and intensely. Prof. Binford gave an illustrated lecture on the subject of public schools in Virginia before the Sum mer Normal which was of genuine interest. Many schools of the State were pictured before the audience The people of the town have re sponded generously to the claims of the widow and children of Mr. Barnwell, who was killed by light ening. The burial of the father and son frpm the same home at the same time was something new in my experience. Mr. R. H. Panlett and the ma dam are at Asbnry Park Mr. and Mrs. D. T.

While in Oeorgla, Mr. Preslnuor was pro moted to first Sergeant for bravery on tho fl-ld of notion. H ots now a member of Eoitra Post, fl. A. R., an I Is one of tho m03t popular men in the Post. Mr. Preslaner told a reporter the story of his dreadful Illness and wondeyful recovery. The reporter met him as he whs returning from a long walk, an l, saying that he had h nrd of his wonderiil cure, asked him to tell tho story. When Mr. Preslauor wns com fortably sealed in his pleasant parlor, he told the following story, which, he said, he hoped evoryono who was suffering as ho hud suffer!, would rend. Ills words were as follows To begin with, 1 was taken slek just n year and a mouth ago, having taken a severe cold whiuh sett I d on mv kidneys. At first I thought the pain I suffered won Id soon pass away, but, instead ot doing this, It grow more intense every dnv, so that In a week I could walk only with considerable difficulty.  I colled In a doctor, who said I had loco motor ataxia and began treating me for that disease. He did me no good, and all sum mer long I could scnrooly attend lo my busi ness at all. Thou I called another doctor and took his medicine for several weeks, btit ex perienced no relief. Dr. Truman Nichols, of No. 237 East Broadway, who I at Inst oallel In, helped mo more than anv of the other dootors, but along towards foil I grew worso, despite his treatment. I think Dr. Nichole Is a good doctor nnd understood my case, but deepito this fact his medicines did me no lasting good. Early In November the little strength I ha l In rny logs left me and I was unablo to stand. The pain in my back and sides be came almost unbearable and my limbs grew cold. An eeotrlo battery I bought failed to help, nnd for weeks I felt mysolf gradually growing weaker until all hope left mo. Sometime before this I had read of a won derful cur  a man had received from Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People, bat was so prejudiced against what I thought was a patent medicine ot the usual worthless char acter hut I could not make up my mind to try them. As my pains increased and death seemed ooming near, I thought Ot what I ha I read and ot the symptoms of the man who had been cured. They were precisely the same as mine, and at last, with my wifes earnest entreaty, I consented to try Pink Pills. I am now convinced that those pills saved my.life. Gradually my strength be gun to return, the desire to live grow strong er. After having taken three boxes 1 left my bod. This was early in March. All pain had left me, and that terrible dead feeling In my legs had gone away. I was still very week, but before I bad tiiken tire fourth box I was able to got down stairs for a short walk in the open air. Now I feel as if I hail beon born again and ngi ns happy as a child. Every pleasant day I take a walk, and am sure that iu a month I will be os well ns ever.

The greatest of these it charity. We have been having too mnch raiu of late, but the man who com plains of the season of 1910 is an iugrate. Never did onr fields bring forth more abundantly, and never was onr health record better. At the fir t session of our new town council a petition, numerously signed by the voter and tax-payers of the own, was presented, asking that the question of the sorgeantcy be settled by a primary, but the council in reply said they had no thing to do with a primary and pro ceeded to fill the office made vacant by the retirement of Sergeant Mil ler, by electing Mr. F. W. Hubbard, the vote being 8 to 1. This would indicate that a primary would not have altered the resnP, for if the council ie composed of representa tive men, Mr. Hubbard must be the choice of the people. He is a young man who has won u fine reputation in the usinesB circles of FarmviKs and will no doubt discharge the du ties incident to the position honest ly and well. He was cashier of the tizens State Bank, and when that Bank was merged into the First National, he was made second as sistant cashier. Mr. H. E. Barrow was re-elected president of the body and all the old officers retained. It is said that Mr. W. G. Dunn ing ton has given up the Austrian order which ha has held for so many ears and as a consequence some parties who held positions under him are without work. I have never heard Mr. Dunnington men tion the subject and know nothing of the details. He still holds to the Italian order, as I am told, and this means that he will remain on the market for large quantities of the weed. I have sometimes wondered why he did not give up all active business, retire to his palatial coun try home and spend the evening of life in  otium cam diguiUte. And yet the thrill of trade circles may 4 be that which givfts charm to life. Editor Hart, of the Herald, is very mnch afraid of a thundei storm, and during a recent vi lent on, says that bat for the timely ar rival of his physician with the pro per remady on hand he would have snffered a fearful collapse. I am notoertain as to the component parts of the mixture, but believe I can gaess with some degree of ac curacy.

E. Byrd Grubb was the colo nel during the Civil War. The appro priation for the monument has been made by the State Legislature of New Jersey and the ground on which it will be erected was purchased and donated by Colonel Grubb. Mr. John T. Dale, of Chicago, owner of the Southern Foundry and Machine Works, of Fredericksburg was in that city with a prominent manufacturer of Chicago with a view of inducing him to move his plant, which is the Garland Villa Gas and Machine Company, from that city to Fredericksburg, utilizing the building and grounds of the Southern Foundry for the site. Lester Ruffner, who has been on trial in the Circuit Court of Page County, was given a one-year sentence in the peniten tiary for the attempted murder of his ousin, David Ruffner, about four months ago, at which time the prisoner shot and killed his uncle, Isaac P. Ruffner. For the murder of his uncle Ruffner was given two years in the States prison. The Electoral Board of Richmond, composed of Messrs. F. C. Ebel, W. T. Hancock and Samuel Cohen, through its president, Mr. Ebel, handed its resig nation to the Clerk of the Hustings Court. Nothing can be learned of the reasons actuating the board until the letter is read by Judge Witt, who is out of the city on a fishing trip. It is thought that it is prompted by the allegations made during the grand jury investiga tion of the municipal primary. It is rumored that the members of the board would have resigned some months ago, but were restrained by the advice of friends to wait until the discussion had ceased. The Roanoke City Council and Board of Aldermen held special sessions and voted to offer 250 reward for the ar rest and conviction of the murderer of cx-City Sergeant J. B. Traynham. They also voted to allow the police Jorce 100 for contingencies to be used at the dis- cression of the Mayor. A letter was read from Governor Swanson to the ef fect that he would supplement any re ward offered by the city, and Osceola Lodge, Knights of Pythias, voted a re ward of 100. Much interest was aroused at the Cap itol by the circulation among members of the General Assembly of a pamphlet of 100 pages compiled by Judge George L. Christian to show that his son, W il liam B. Christian, Rowland P. Eubank and Julian M. Sailey were done a gross injustice by the faculty of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in being denied matriculation because of their alleged connection with hazing. A bill had been introduced looking into intervention by the General Assembly on behalf of these young men. The pamphlet is a very interesting paper, and parts of it are spicy. Judge Christian characterizes l he course of the faculty is illegal, un just and improper. United States Sen ator John W, Daniel, in a long and strong letter in behalf of young Chris tian, says There is not a convict in the penitentiary today who did not have a fairer trial. There is not a citizen out of the penitentiary who would put him self, with respect to property, character or civil rights, in the hands of such an unfair procedure as was held at the in stitute. The Shenandoah River Light and Power Company, of Luray, has just pur chased the Luray Electric Companys property in this town for 10,000, the deal becoming operative July 1. Superintendent Driver, of Miller Park, Lynchburg, is arranging for the an nual distribution of potted plants to the children of the city, which will take place about May 1.

Mr. William Wilson, for 36 years Li brarian of the Virginia Senate and a familiar figure about the Capitol for nearly a half century, is dead. He cele brated his seventy-third birthday last summer with a reunion of his children and grandchildren. Mr. Wilson wns a native of England, hut had lived here since young manhood. He served in the Naval Reserves during the Civil War. A widow, two sous and two daughters survive. An attempt was made by unknown parties to blow up Floyd Courthouse with dynamite. Hie Circuit Court is now sitting, and Judge W. W. Moffett is presiding for the first time. The charge was set off in the rear of the building within 40 feet of the county jail. A hole about three feet wide was blown out of the Courthouse just be hind the judges seat. Judge Moffett had just granted bail to Fred Hoback. who secured a new trial through the Supreme Court for the killing of John L. Jett, a hotel-keeper, over a year ago. Hoback was sentenced to eight years in the State penitentiary, but the verdict oi the lower court was set aside. Hoback was a rural letter carrier and was re turning from a trip when he and Jett met in front of the Courthouse and a difficulty ensued, in which Hoback was seriously cut screral times, after which he shot Jett, killing him instantly. Ho back will probably ask for a change of venue at the next trial, which is set for the April term of Court. Mr. F.. M. Daniel, son of Senator John V. Daniel, has resigned the presidency of the General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia and has been succeeded by Morgan P. Robinson. Os car D. Randolph was added to the ex ecutive board. William B. Auld, a Richmond sales man, was thrown from a buggy and pain fully hurt, among his injuries being a broken arm and the almost compete sev erance of one ear. H. P. Hanshaw, who has been work ing as a brakeman on the Norfolk and Western Railway, gave himself up to the Norfolk police, declaring that he was guilty of forging the name of his brother- in-law to a paper by which he obtained 63, and stating that he wanted to be sent back to his home in Tazewell, for trial. Henshaw said he was 26 years old. Tinker Ruffin, the negro charged with the shooting and wounding of Warren Brown at Hebron, Dinwiddie County, some years ago and robbing him of 600, and who was arrested at Phili- delphia recently and brought back to Dinwiddie County for trial, had a pre liminary hearing before Justice Briggs at Dinwiddie Courthouse.
