Elections in Brazil. A writer in Argonaut declares that in Brazil the elections arc a farce, tne ballots are hardly ever counted, for the government nominates its ticket, ana then, after an election, announces all its candidates elected. A year or so ago. he says, an American, who had settled in Bahia, the second largest city in Brazil, was made an election clerK, ard was told to bring the returns from an interior towm into Bahia. After the electron had closed, the clerk took the returns nd hastened away, guarding them with the greatest car. He rode his horse hart, for he felt that the sus pense would be great at Bahia until the returns he was carrying were received. What was his chagrttl, therefore, to hand his package over to the chiet election clerk, only to, see it thrown into the waste-basket. .  Here, what are you doing? he shouted. . Throwing them away, was the an swer, we dont need-them now.  Dont need them? stammered the American, who had been brought up to regard a violation of the election laws as treasonable. .  The government has eiccted its men already, was the answer we don t need any more voles.  Here the inspector opened the pack age and showed the astonished Ameri can a quantity of blanks, each of which was signed, with a space to be fills! in with any number necessary to elect the government candidates.  ----------- - --------- -  man Amusements Halls tor our Soldiers. wj1QS A year ago Congress appropriated five hundred thousand 4ollars for the construction and equipment of amuse- ment halls at first-class army posts, and the p a building for this purpose to cost one H hundred and twenty-five thousand dol- A lars is to be constructed at Fort Myer. lars.

Broke out, indeed! and my mus tache as respectable a size as any one could expect from three months nursing. And only yesterday Ara- minta Jones had said it was divine, and just as scratchy as need be. I was angry, but a glance at the sweet face of Bessie made me re strain my temper. What could I not bear for her sake? I used to know pretty near all your folks, said old Blake,  and theres a heap of em I should like to ask about if I could only get my wits to work. Thera was your Uncle Joshua you dont remember him, I guess he died afore your time   I never had an Uncle Joshua, said I. Dont contradict me, my boy, said he, testily  I ghess I know. Taint likely they ever told you any thing about him. He was put in the state prison for stealing sheep or was it a pig? Now, father, said the old lady, dont you go for to harrering up the boys feelings. He cant help what his uncle did.   I haint a harrering, said old Blake, crossly.  You mind your own bizness, Martha.  And while the old people were dis puting as to the real meaning of the word  harrerin, I improved the chance which offered, and kissed Bes sie. Before this fact was accomplished, a tall, red-whiskered man strode into the room, and, for an instant, stood glaring at me like a wild beast. Then he dashed toward me, seized me by the collar and planted his foot at that part of my body most convenient to kick, and landed ine at the other side of the room. Take that, you scoundrel! he re marked, impressively but I could not oblige him. I had already taken it. I rose to my feet and prepared to strike out. What do you mean, sir? de manded I, before striking. What do you mean, sir? de nwinded he. What do you mean by kissing my wife?  Your wife! Jupiter Jorum! cried I.  Bessie Blake your wife?  Bessie Blake? said he.  Whc in thunder is Bessie Blake?  Dont be profane, my son, said old Mrs. Blake.  Scripter is agin it.  Are you not Bessie Blake? said I, turning to the Venus. No, said she  my name is Annie Hall. Well, said I, this is a pretty kettle of fish. Who are you, sir? to the red-whiskered man.  I am Robert Hall, at your service  Mr. Blakes step-son.  Isnt this Mr. Moses Blakes house?  No my name is Jeremiah, said old Blake.  And I was going to Moses Blakes, said I.  Why in the deuce didnt ydu go there, then? cried Mr. Hall.  Dont swear, Robert, expostu lated Mrs. Blake.  How, was I to tell one house from another in this abominable village? cried I, indignantly,  where every hou.se is just like every other one.  My house cost twice as much as Moses Blakes, said Mr. lake. Aint your name Jeremiah? asked Mrs. Blake. Mercy forbid! said I.  Then, said she,  I guess things is kinder mixed up. We are expect ing our nephew, Jeremiah Muggins, for to pay us a visit. He writ some time ago to say hed come. We haint seen him sence he was a child, and naterly we took you for him. And the fact of it is youve got into the wrong house. I saw how !t was, apologized, ob tained definite directions as to the locality of Mr. Moses Blakes heuse, and departed. The less I say of my visit there the better. Bessie weighed a couple of hundred, to say the least, and was red and healthy as a washerwoman. A fine girl, no doubt, but not to my taste.

Why do you ask? T v e just had all my white Leg horns stolenforty of them. Every one round here is losing chickens. Now those chickens have to be mar keted somewhereand not around here. Its fifty miles to the city, which is the safest place to m arket them. If I stole chickens, Id freight them down, dressed and packed in barrels. So I thought if anybody round here was doing the thieving and the thieves, whoever they are, take the local paper, and certainly do know this part of the county as well as their hand  I m ight get some hint from your shipments. Thats a first rate idea, said the young man. But I dont remember any special shipper of dressed poul try in barrels. The W alter boys pack that way, but I guess were not sus pecting them! Mrs. Dixon sends a barrel now and then. So do the peo ple on the Lawrence farm th ats been an experimental poultry farm for the last year. I hear they report they lost badly through a raid by the thieves two months ago. The Elliotts, over at Orwell, send dressed poultry, too, but never very much. It doesnt seem------- .No, it doesnt, said Dorothy, looking perplexed. But these chick ens have got to get to market, Frank, somehow. Ive started to hunt this county over till I find whats become of them. I guess Id better drive to the other stations up and down the road. Theyd be likely to choose a stupid agent to ship through, so I dnt wonder they keep away from here. Then she flushed a t having paid Frank a compliment, and Frank flushed, too, with pleasure, for he knew that his pretty schoolmate never said things unless she meant them. It p u t him on his mettle. But see here, Dorothy, why do you have to drive up and down the road? W hats the m atter with my telegraphing instead? Come in and sit down, and I ll get you all the in formation you want in half an hour. So Dorothy sat and listened to the clicking w.ires, and took some brief notes on a telegraph pad that Frank pushed over to her across the table. Wagner, at Dorrance station, says that the Lawrence farm sends a bar rel now and then and a crate occa sionally. The Widow Ransom is the heaviest shipper sends both crates and barrels. Jones, at Pond station, says Hank Janeway ships a barrel sometimes so does the Lawrence farm. The Browns send a crate now and then white Leghorns and Ply mouth Rocks. Collins, at Pelham Junction, says that Mrs. Robinson ships more than anybody else, but Jim Henry sends a barrel or a crate now and then, and so does the Law rence peoplePlymouth Rocks, most ly. King, at Bellevue station, says everybody sends in crates, except a barrel now and then from the Law rence people and Sally W alker. Frank leaned back and whistled softly. Dorothy smiled and pushed the telegraph pad under his eyes. Five underlinings marked the name Lawrence repeated in each of the five reports from Milby, Dorrance, Pond, Pelham and Bellevue. You clever girl! said Frank. Youve got hold of the right end. No honest poultry farm ever shipped that much to the city, and through five different stations in small lots. But supposing its so, how are we go ing to prove it? The man doesnt live who can identify an ordinary white Leghorn hen or Plymouth Rock pul let. But the girl does! cried Dorothy, triumphantly. Since day before yesterday I can pick out any one of my forty Leghorns with absolute cer tainty, Frank. I I dipped their legs, every one of them, in a fast black that wont come off, so that I could know them again if they were stolen. Frank Evans lay back in his chair and laughed delightedly. Dorothy, you always were at the head of the class, he said, heartily. But what are you going to do now? Im going to the Lawrence farm , said Dorothy, unfastening the hitch ing strap. You mustnt do that. They might do you an injury. W ait till I can get a constable and a search warrant. You m ustnt go alone, Dorothy. , I wont have it. I dont mind a search w arrant, said Dorothy, with composure. That is what I brought this for. She pulled out the mysterious box, and disclosed various brightly labeled bottles and packages. I am Miss Jane Smith, Frank, agent for these poultry remedies, which I am driv ing about the county introducing among intelligent poultry farmers. I shall get into the Lawrence chicken yards, and come away again without any trouble, thank you. But I should like the constable to be at the end of the lane, ready to come in a little later. Ill get Dick Williams to tend the station, said Frank, and drive over with you p u t the constables and"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Jones"], "snippet": "both crates and barrels. <mark>Jones</mark>, at Pond station, says"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Jones"], "snippet": "both crates and barrels. <mark>Jones</mark>, at Pond station, says"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
