The passing of the beloved young David A. Christian, III, gives us occasion to observe that by and large, this community has overworked and underpaid its medical men. Young doctors have scant incentive to go to rural areas, with the long hours, endless driving, and small compen sation, in comparison to what is offered in larger centers. These things the hours, the driv ing, and small compensation, are the handicaps we must face. But face them we must, for Ap pomattox cannot ocntinue to over burden the medical men we do have available. Our best thinking must be done to seek the solution to this pressing problem. Appeals must be made to the medical schools and placement groups, but to back up those appeals we must be prepared with data. A long -range solution to this problem, which is but typical of the same situation all over the country, is for the armed forces to release to civilian service some of the young doctors they are holding in service. Vast numbers of the civilian doctors are over-age, but simply cannot retire. Young doctors arent getting the experience in general practice they used to get they are spending their first years as doctors in the armed services as specialisits and many have no taste for general rural practice when they complete their tours of duty. Again, our medical schools must be expanded, and more young men induced to go through the years of study and preparation for a career as doctors. But these long range sugestions do not help us right now. Let us cooperate so far as possible to lighten the load on our doctors, and use what means may be avail able to induce another young doctor to settle in our midst."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["David", "A", "Christian"], "snippet": "of the beloved young <mark>David</mark> <mark>A</mark>. <mark>Christian</mark>, III, gives us occasion"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["David", "A", "Christian"], "snippet": "of the beloved young <mark>David</mark> <mark>A</mark>. <mark>Christian</mark>, III, gives us occasion"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

CHRISTIAN Note Permission has been ob tained to publish the following let ter.  j Pamplin, Va, February 28, 1955. Dr. David A. Christian, Jr. Dear Dr. Christian, I must write this letter before another day is gone. Perhaps you consider this letter as one coming from the entire population of the little town of Pamplin and the sur rounding community. My vocabulary and education are far too limited to properly express the deep feeling of loss suffered by the tragic death of Dr. David, III. Everyone who had ever been ac quainted with him either socially or professionally loved him. His daily life and the practice of his profession was a shining example of witnessing for Christ. His was a life of service, daily practicing to the letter the Hippo cratic Oath. Many times he was called to out town, and always he came willingly and quickly, giving to all his pro fessional skill and kindness, re gardless of race, color or creed. His serene manner brought order out of chaos to many homes, and when nothing more could be done he left comfort and courage in those homes. This must have stem med from a deep abiding faith in God. I am a graduate nurse R. N. and became well acquainted with him.

Christian, Jr. Dear Dr. Christian, I must write this letter before another day is gone. Perhaps you consider this letter as one coming from the entire population of the little town of Pamplin and the sur rounding community. My vocabulary and education are far too limited to properly express the deep feeling of loss suffered by the tragic death of Dr. David, III. Everyone who had ever been ac quainted with him either socially or professionally loved him. His daily life and the practice of his profession was a shining example of witnessing for Christ. His was a life of service, daily practicing to the letter the Hippo cratic Oath. Many times he was called to oui town, and always he came willingly and quickly, giving to all his pro- fessionaly skill and kindness, re gardless of race, color or creed.

Purely the ninth of April 1865 was one of those days. At its recurrence each year our minds eye goes back to that ever memorable day and re views the scenes that then occurred. This scribe, though then only a boy in his teens, was one of the 8,000 soldiers that surrendered his musket on that occasion, and well does he remember the feeling of despair that filled his bosom when the dreadful news came that General Lee had sent forward the flag of truce and was negotiating the terms of surrender. Every hope that had brought him to the heroic struggle for liberty, was then thought forever gone. Oh, how vividly do we remember seeing our dearly beloved Lee coming back on his noted war horse Traveller and bringing the sad, sad news that he had surrendered. As he approached, his old soldiers gathered around him, soldiers of all ages and conditions of life, from boys in their teens to the old wrinkled veterans, from men who bore the proudest names in our Southland to those who could not even write their own names but who clung to their beloved leader with no less devotion, all bound together as one man by a common cause, a common love for their countrv, those"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["David", "A", "Christian"], "snippet": "tox, written by Judge <mark>David</mark> <mark>A</mark>. <mark>Christian</mark>, father of Dr. D."}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["David", "A", "Christian"], "snippet": "tox, written by Judge <mark>David</mark> <mark>A</mark>. <mark>Christian</mark>, father of Dr. D."}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
