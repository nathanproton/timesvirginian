Flood to suc ceed himself as Senator from this district, iu a speech which was well received, by the audience, and which elicited much applause, showing plainly that the audience endorsed his eulogistic remarks on Mr. Flood and his record as a representative. Mr. Gray is a pleasant speaker, aud his remarks were timely and highly appreciative. Mr, A. B. Thornhill, of Appomat tox, in a beautiful speech, seconded the nomination of Mr. Flood. He referred to the magnanimity with which Mr. Flood refused the certifi cate of election to Congress in 1896, and presented figures showing that iie received 4,000 more votes than diu Mr. Tucker in 1894, and 6,000 more than did Mr. Quarles in 1898. Mr. Thornhills remarks made a good impressiou, and he was the re cipient of congratulations upon his peech. Messrs. F. C. Moon and Ednt. W. Hubard, ou the part of Bucking ham, made short speeches seconding the nomination. At the conclusion of these speech es Mr. Paul Pettit moved that the nomination be made by acclamation, which was adopted, and the chair appointed Messrs. Gray, Thornhill, and Hubard to iuform Mr. Flood of his nomination, and to present him to the convention. Mr. Flood accepted the nomina tion in a speech of twenty minutes, which aroused much enthusiasm. He assured the peopie of his appie- fiaaou of the honor conferred, and of their endorsement and loyalty, to him and his public acts. He spoke earnestly of the faithful service to the laboring people of Virginia ren dered by Senator Martin, aud of the light he made for him in the Demo cratic caucus six years ago, assuring the Democracy of Virginia that, if- they would lay the mantle of the seuatorship upon Mr. Martin at that time, the Democracy of the Old Do minion would approve their action. Mr. Flood referred to the large ma jority of counties having gone for Senator Martin as proving the truth of his prediction, and said that Mr. Martin would be renominated by a four-fifths majority. At the con clusion of his speech he was pre sented wit-h a bouquet of beautiful flowers. Mr. F. 0. Moon offered the follow ing resolutions, which weie unani mously adopted Resolved, That the course of Hon. T. S. Martin, United States Senator, is fully endorsed and approved and the nomiuee of this convention is in structed to vote for and support Him for re-election to that position. . 2d, That the tiominee of this con vention is instructed to vote for and support Hon. George J. Hundley for re-electiou as Judge of this judicial circuit. Mr. W. W. Haskins said that he was instructed by the Maysville-dis- trict meeting to bring up the ques tion of moving the courthouse aud the nominee was instructed to op pose any movement looking to the removal of the courthouse. The senatorial convention then adjourned, and the house conven tion, composed of delegates from Buckingham and Cumberland, as sembled for the purpose of nomi nating a candidate for the House of Delegates. Dr. Pratt and Mr. Haskins were retained as chairman and secretary, respectively, of the convention.  W. M. Smith, of Cumberland, and F. C.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

LaBaume, Indus trial A gent of the N.  W . Ry., who had been invited to ad dress the farm ers, was intro duced by Mr. Thornhill, and made a very practical speech, interspersed by many am using jokes. He paid Appomattox a high com plim ent on her splen did enterprise, progress and commended especially the I great Work being done by Prof. Crawley in our fine Agricul tural College. He told the farm ers how to beautify their  homes and keep the boys on the farm. Mr. LaBaume is a good speaker and the large audience enjoyed his rem arks very much and no doubt w ill gather some inspiration there from fpr greater effort tow ards real progress. . President Ganaway, pf Cum berland, w ae present and made an address w hich was much enjoyed.  Btate Secretary D. M. Blank- inship, of Campbell County, was also present and m ade a good business talk to the far mers. The day was strictly a far m ers day and they are to be congratulated on the big suc cess of their picnic, and now we w ant to move that they m ake thefourth Friday in Au gust every year the annual picnic day of the Farm ers Union at Appomattox. The interest and attendance shows th at the Union is here to stay and th at the substantial saving which is being made to the farm ers in their respective Unions is worth the considera tion of those who are not mem bers. There were several m atch games of base ball played, and the entire day was given over to one of pleasure and social intercourse. Come again farm ers, and long live the Union."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["J", "W", "Thornhill"], "snippet": "of the County Union, <mark>J</mark>. <mark>W</mark> .
