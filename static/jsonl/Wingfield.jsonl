One bill of State-wide interest in the Senate makes it necessary to se cure a State license to carry deadly or dangerous weapons. -Senator Paul, of the Republican mi nority, is working in the interest of a measure to have at least one Repub lican on every electoral board throughout the State. The bill for a change in the city charter of Richmond for the creation of an administrative board, previously passed by the House, was passed in the Senate under a suspension of the rules, and now goes to Governor Mann for his signature. Delegate Cox, of Richmond, intro duced a resolution providing that Gov ernor Woodrow Wilson, of New Jer sey, be invited to address  joint ses sion of the legislature and of the Rich mond City Council on Thursday night, February 1, at 8 oclock. The resolu tion was unanimously passed, and when sent to the Senate was concur red in. One of the most Important bills in troduced in the House was presented by Delegate Harwood, of Richmond, providing for the amendment to the section of the code governing the state tax on corporations for the sup port of free schools, pensions and liquidation of the public debt. The present law provides a maximum fee of 600, imposed upon a company with a capital of 1,000,000, while on a company capitalized at 999,000 the tax is 199.80. It was announced in both Houses that the joint committee on roads would have a public hearing on the questions of roads and workirfe con victs thereon, according to the recom mendations of Governor Mantl, on Monday, January ?9. One of the provisions of the charter amendment bill for the city of Rich mond, which has passed both Houses of the legislature and is now in thte hands of Governor Mann for his signature, reads that the city has the right to erect and maintain, in con nection with the city prison, if the I Council so determines, a suitable  workhouse and a bouse of correction, to compel and require all able-bodied i adult prisoners confined to perform anual labor in such workhouse and to  employ all youthful prisoners in the house of correction. Many representatives of the south west section of the state were here t,o oppose any changes in the redistrict ing of the Ninth district, the Dem ocrats believing that if the district is left undisturbed they have an excel lent chance to elect a successor to Congressman Bascom Slemp, the in cumbent, in the coming November election. , ."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Wingfield"], "snippet": "missioner, and J.
