Geo. H. Wiley, I wrote at once and secured his services for revival meeting. Brother Wiley came on April the 9th full of the spirit of the Master and  preached with great power and effect. The word- of God was quick and powerful and was glorified in accomplishing much good  at one service about twenty five young men came to the altar nearly all or whom have been happily converted. The secret of this brothers success is his humility of spirit and power to draw people to him. His style simple and expository, yet when he speaks his hearers are lostin the depth of his thoughts. Never before have th\u00e8 people of this town and surround ing country been so stirred by plain gospel truth. The good people of Appomattox circuit are to be congratulated on having such an humble man of God to serve them, while they are com mended for their kindness in allow ing Brother Wiley to assist in win ning souls to Christ at other places. While my people here would have contributed largely to compensate Brother Wiley for his services he would receive nothing. The prayer of hundreds follow this brother to his circuit and other places, that he may work for Christ. Both young men and maidens, old men and children, let them praise the name of the Ixrd.

As one of the earliest dealers in Virginias Piedmont, Oscar Jam erson loaded the first pulpwood at the depot in Appomattox in 1981 for the Hummel Ross Company, the predecesor of Continentals Hopewell. mfli. The histoiy of the 0. S. Jamerson Company parallels the development and produc tion of pulpwood in the Virginia Pjpdmont and its impact on the economy, in the area and the concomitant growth of the paper industry. Mr. Jam ersons business grew during the 1980s and he began loading pulpwood, cross- ties, and mine props at several other locations in Virginia. He operated woodyards at Phenix. Lynchburg, Pamplin, Lowry, Prospect and Concord. Phenix was the most active of all these yards. During this time, Mr. Jamerson shipped most of his pulpwood to Hopewell. As close as could be determined from several sourc es, Mr. Jamerson received from 4.00 to 5.00 per unit for peeled pine pulpwood at the beginning. Out of that rate he had to pay labor, loading and stumpage. Railroad sidings and land was used free at that time to anyone who had a .commodity to load. Around 1940, Jack G ant from Boones Mill, Virginia became very active in the crocstie and pulpwood business in the state of Virginia and especially on the NAW Railroad.
