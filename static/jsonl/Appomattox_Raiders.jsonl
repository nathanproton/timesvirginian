Just ask anyone who follows Appo mattox County High School varsity football. But after eight years of playing an opponent, victory is sweet, andit was particularly succulent to the approximately 2,500 assem bled in Bragg Stadium Friday night when the Raiders defeated arch-foe Rustburg, 24-21. Summing up the essence of FridayTs game, coach Stuart Justus says, We outplayed them in the secoid half, thats all there is to it. A tenacious Raider defense held the Red Devils to a total of 30 yards offense in the second half, and the Devils executed only 18 plays on offense in the second half. Rustburg jumped out to an early two-touchdown advantage, and added a third score in the second quarter. But the Raiders narrowed the margin with three scores in the second quarter, on a one-yard plunge by quarterback Ke vin Ferguson, a 47-yard touchdown pass from Fer guson to Ernest Daye, and a 50-yard touchdown pass from Ferguson to Pete Mclvor. The score stood at 2118 as the first half ended. The Raider defense stif fened in the second half, and tailback Dennis Fleshmans 40-yard scamper into the end zone gave the home team the advantage as the game entered the home stretch. But, with time running out in the fourth- quarter, the Raiders let Red Devil Wellington Wheaton get around the right corner of the defense on a punt return, and the speedy Rustburg runner took the ball into the end zone. But alas, football is a game of breaks, and Wheatons scor ing run was canceled by a clipping penalty. I thought the game was pretty even as far as breaks go, Justus said in reference to the recalled touchdown. We did give them a touchdown in the first half the Devils scored one of their three touchdowns on a fumble recovery following a bad snap from center on a punt attem pt deep in Appomattox territory. The Raiders passing game surprised many at Fridays contest. Ferguson went five for 11 and 185 yards, including Ernest Dayes two receptions for 109 yards and a score, and Dennis Fleshmans two catches for 27 yards. Fleshman also led  the Raiders running game, carrying 19 times lor 132 yards. The Raiders got 15 first downs in the game, and Rustburg nine, including three on penalties. Were still making some mistakes, Justus said of his young tem. Penalties, players not being on the field when theyre supposed to be, are two examples.
