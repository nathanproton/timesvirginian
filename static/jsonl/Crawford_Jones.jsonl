The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

It was approached by two roads meeting at right angles at the horse rack. How ofteu as Jim Robertson and myself would strike the clearing on one road, would we see Dauiel Isbell, Buck Trent and Crawford Jones approacuing on the other, when we would all dismount in a group at the gate.. On one occasion Christmas night the Major gave an oyster supper. Among the guests were the old people of the neighborhood m the private part of the mansion and enough of us younger ones to nearly fill the parlor. As the wee sma hours of the night approached, the older people came into the parlor as they dotted their wraps for the night ride home. For a moment there was a scarcity of seats, and while the small butler, Archer was bring ing in chairs, the old Major thought to fill in the time with a little trick for the boys. His plan was to place a lighted candle on the table, blind fold a boy, make him turn three times and approach the candle to blow it out. Bob West was a very bashful boy. He had a hen-house and was fond of chickens, and had been after his father fora few pul lets he had bought for the table. To induce him to try the candle the Major said, Come, Bob, if you will blow it out 111 give you two of my pullets. Buck Trent, who had 1 . ig had a weakness for one of the Majors pretty daughters, jumped up, and with that brass that only Buck could show, said, Major, if youll just give me one of your pul- lets Ill blow it out. Of course the room roared, and the Major had to give attention to Archer and the chairs. A little northwest of the Court house lived Dr. Palmer, au educated, refined, accomplished old Virginian gentleman. Like Doc Sifeis, he tramped tnose roads and forded those streamsor swum umfor two generations. I cau remember when he kept three horsfts, aud kept them all busy, too. He must have bad an iron constitution. His practice em braced Appomattox, a portion of Campbell and Buckingham and of ten over into Amherst.

The dog got thirty-four at one time and twenty-six at another, and Mrs. Thornhill wonders if there is another such a record in Virginia. The terrier was set after the rats when they began to deplete a flock of chickens. Danville.Leonard Crawford, 8-year- old son of S. T. Crawford sustained a badly broken leg when he fell from a tree from which he was watching the baseball game from outside the fence. He was fully thirty feet from the ground when the branch he was sit ting on and which was decayed snapped. He was removed to the hos pital where the damaged leg was set. Harrisonburg.. The Rockingham National Bank, of Harrisonburg, was the successful bidder for the 150,000 issue of the city of Harrisonburg 5 per cent, bonds of twenty-year serial, according to an announcement made by city officials. The issue was re cently authorized by the City Council for extensive addition to the citys light and water system. Bids were re ceived from a number of the largest bonding houses in the country and the accepted bid was slightly above par. Charlottesville.Albert S. Bolling of the Albemarle bar, who officiated as toastmaster at a banquet given by the local American Legion posts, evoked cheers .by his violent attack upon local profiteers. Mentioning no names, he stated that every one pres ent knew of men who had accumu lated fortunes by remaining at home during the war, giving to war work mere pittances of what they made, and that whenever he saw one of these fnen he felt a great pride in the hum blest member of the American Legion Blackstone.With the conferring ot degrees on a class of 133 young men the largest in the history of the col lege, by President Burruss, the ad dress to the class of 1922 by Dr. W.

Richmond.Stressing that unless there is immediate relief from ex cessive freight rates jobbing interests in Virginia cities would be crippled Colonel R. McC. Bullington, address ing the eighteenth annual session of the Richmond Association of Credit Men at the Westmoreland Club urged concerted action for a square deal. He expressed the opinion that these job- hers  are not getting fair treatment .from the .transportation interests, wbose rails run through Virginia, and declared for subscriptions to a fund which would be devoted to fighting the unjust, unfair and unreasonable rates of carriers. Richmond.Commissioners at large to investigate on the feasibility of es tablishing a separate school for deaf and blind were named by Governor E. Lee Trinkle. The commission consists of Dr. Mary E. Brydon, of the State Board of Health, and Professor Chas- G. Maphis, of the University of Vir ginia, and two members of Ihe House and two of the Senate. The report will be submitted to the next General Assembly. The Governor named the commission for the blind as follows! R. J. Taylor, Staunton W. L. Hop kins, Richmond Miss Elizabeth Pidgeon, University of Virginia Sam uel H. Miller, Lynchburg, and E. Sum ter Smith, Lynchburg. New Canton.After the lapse of five weeks since the severe frosts of April, it has been ascertained, after careful examination of many orchards in this section, that the damage done to all kinds of fruit exceeded the first cal culations. Commercially, the apple crop is practically a failure. Locally, the delicious apples seem to have escaped with the least damage, while winesaps suffered a heavy loss. The Boatwright Orchards at Gold Hill suf fered less than any orchard in this section, owing to its high location. The crop there will possibly exceed 3t per cent. The orchards of A. L. Pitts, at Arvonia, and of Plummer F. Jones, in New Canton, contain about 10 per cent. of a crop. Blacksburg.Twelve hundred and thirty-two out of the 1,647 enrolled alumni of Virginia Polytechnic Insti tute were present and participated in the alumni day program of the golden jubilee celebration. Headed by Dr. Lawrence Priddy, of New York, presi dent of the General Alumni Assocla tion, the alumni from 1872 to 1921 in seventeen minutes subscribed 72,742 towards a 100,000 fund for the erec tion of a war memorial hall, which will be designed to house the various organizations and societies of the in stitut 9 n, providing dancing halls, re- ceptkm rooms and more than forty roomskfor reStal purposes to those taking post-graduate courses. Richmond.Decrease in rents in the early fall is freely predicted by real estate men here as a result of the immense number of dwellings now uu der construction. The increase in homes has become noticeable through the .for rent signs now appearing through the city. Ths.t the average drop will approximate 10 per cent, is the opinion of the rental agents. A survey of the situation indicates that there will be considerable moving on September 1, when new leases for the year become operative. Danville.Rev. SiB.

But an ex amination of the facts Ir the case will show that there is as mnch doubt as to whether this Is really the body of the American commander as there Is abont the true identity of this person age, whose career  om birth to death Is one of the unsolved riddles of the Revolutionary war. In the first place, Jones was not the real name of this hero, but one adopted by him in later years. He was born with the name John Paul and there Is much doubt as to whether he was the true or the adopted son of the Scotch gardener In whose cottage he spent the first 12 years of his life. Crawford, author of The Sailor Whom England F6a red and one of the leading authorities on the life of John Paul Jones, admits that mystery sur rounded his origin with an Impenetra ble veil and that he encountered great difficulties In his efforts to sift the false from the true, the legend from the facta The generally accepted story Is that John Paul was born In the little village of Arbigland and that his father was . poor man, half gardener and half fisherman, while his mother was o f pure Highland stock. But Crawford expresses more than a doubt that the Pauls were really the boys parents, but has been unable to delve further into the mystery, John Pauls brother was adopted by a Virginia planter by the name of Jones and, when this planter died he left his estate to bis adopted son upon condition that he take the same name. The brother, in turn, died shortly after ward, willing the property to John Paul upon the same condition. Thus John Paul- became John Paul Jones, the name by which be Is known and revered. When, after his memorable naval exploits, John Paul Jones finally died in France his death was practically unnoticed in America and the only record of the place of his burial was that left by a friend, for use, as he said, If America should ever wish to perform her duty to the one to whom she owed the most. Whether this memorandum of the grave was correct is a matter which caused much discussion about a cen tury afterward when Gen. Horace Por ter, American ambassador to France, discovered after a long search what was alleged to Le the body of John Paul Jones, exceptionally well pre served in a leaden casket filled with alcohol. The measurements of the body compared exactly with those in the possession of the Navy department at Washington, but the total absence of other distinguishing marks raised a doubt as to the real identity of the bodythough United States officials agreed to treat It as If ft were the real remains of-the naval hero. A squadron was sent to France to escort the body home and France paid great official honor to the man who, a century before, had fought with dis- tiuctlon under many flags. When the casket finally reached the United States it -was received with much pomp and ceremony and conducted to the cradle of the American navy at Annapoliswhere It remained In ob scurity under a flight of steps for many months awaiting the completion of its final resting place. Butthere Is doubt In the minds of many as to whether this is actually the body of the famous commander of the Bon Homme Richard, just as there will always be a mystery sur rounding the actual identity of the man who commenced life as John Paul, the son of a Scotch gardener."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Jones"], "snippet": "In the first place, <mark>Jones</mark> was not the real"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Jones"], "snippet": "In the first place, <mark>Jones</mark> was not the real"}], "text_match": 1155199671761633401, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1112386306048", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1155199671761633401", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
