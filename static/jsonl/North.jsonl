The Seige of Jerusalem vv. 1-3. 1. Time of vv. 1, 2. It began on the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiahs reign and -lasted about eighteen months. The tenth month according to the Jewish calendar corresponds to our December- January, as their calendar year began about the middle of March. The reason the exact time is given is that this was to be an event of great importance to the Jews in their exile. 2. The Method v. 1. Nebuchadnez zar came in person with a large army and encamped against Jerusalem and built forts against it round about. It is thought that siege walls were built, around the city, shotting it in. On the tops Of these walls forts were built from which missiles of destruction could be hurled by their engines of war against the city. With the city shut in its fall was only a question of time. 3.

V Takes Lot to Sink One Of Uncle Sams Ships WASHINGTON.A torpedo from a U-boat clipped off the stern of the destroyer escort Fogg, but her crew got her safely to a friendly port 400 miles away. The action occurred last Decem ber 20 north of the Azores in the Atlantic, but the navy withheld the story until recently. The Fogg has been repaired and is ready to fight again. The torpedo ripped into the ship just aft of the deckhouse when she turned to give assistance to a dis abled landing ship in a convoy. The explosion hurled the Foggs fantail into the air and the entire stern sec tion began to settle. Within minutes, a third of the ship was flooded.

This is indicated by Virginia tests and reports from other states. VPI agronomists say In addition to having low yields, these varieties are very susceptible to leaf spot and other diseases common to the east ern part of the United States. It is hard in most cases to maintain a satisfactory stand under Virginias humid conditions, and there is no indication to date in the east that creeping alfalfa is any more suitable for grazing than standard varieties. Two creeping alfalfa varieties, Nomad and Rhizoma, have received the .most attention publicity-wise, and seed of each is available.

Yes, sir. How did he happen to catch us ou El Capitan? He saw a fire on Music mountain and watched the lower end of the gap all night. Sassoon was a wide-awake man.  Well, Pm sorry, Pardaloe, con tinued De Spain after a moment No body could call It my faul. It was either he or Ior the life of a woman who never harmed a hair of his head, and a woman Tm bound to protect. He was running- when he was hit. If he had got to cover again there was noth ing to stop him from picking both of us off. He was hit ln the head. De Spain was silent. It was a soft-nose bullet contin ued Pardaloe. Again there was a pause. HPU tell you about th at too, Pardaloe, Do Spain went on collectedly. I lost my rifle before that man opened fire on us. Nan happened to have her rifle with herIf she hadnt hed ve dropped one or both of us off El Capi tan. We were pinned against the wall Uke a couple of targets. If there were soft-nose bullets ln her rifle Its be cause she uses them on gamebobcats and mountain Ilona. I never thought of it till this minute. That Is It What I came up to fell you has to do with Dave Sassoon. From what happened today ln the gap I thought you ought to know It now. Gale and Duke quarreled yesterday over the way things turned out they were pretty bitter. This afternoon Gale took It up again with his uncle, and It ended ln Dukes driving him clean out of the gap. Where has he gone? Nobody knows yet. Ed WIckwire told me once that your father was shot from ambush u good mnny years ng6. It was north of Medicine Bend, on a ranch near the Peace river that you never found out who killed him, and that one reason why you came up Into this country was to keep an eye out for a clue. What nbout It? asked De Spain, his tone hardening. I was riding home one night about a month ago from Oalabasas with Sas soon. Hed been drinking. I let him do the talking. He began cussing you out, and talked pretty hard about what youd done, and what hed done, and what he was going to do Nothing, It seemed, would hurry the story. Finally, Sassoon says That hound dont know yet who got his dad. It was Duke Morgan thats who got him. I was with Duke when he turned the trick. We rode down to De Spains ranch one night to look up a rustler. That, concluded Pardaloe, was all Sassoon would say. He stopped. II seemed to wnlt. There was no word of answer, none of comment from the man sitting near him. But, for one, at least, who heard the passionless, monotonous recital of a murder of the long ago, there fol lowed a silence as relentless as fate, a silence shrouded ln the mystery of the darkness and striking despair Into two heartsa silence more fearful than any word. Pardaloe shuffled his feet. He coughed, but he evoked no response, I thought you was entitled to know, he said finally. Now that Sassoon will never talk any more. De Spain moistened his lips. When he spoke his voice was cracked and harsh, as It with what he had heard he had suddenly grown old. You are right, Pardaloe. I thank you. Iwhen Iln the morning. Par daloe, for the present, go back to the gap. I will talk with WIckwireto morrow.  Good night, Mr. de Spain. Good night, Pardaloe. Bending forward, Ump, ln his chair, supporting his head vacantly on his hands, trying to think and fearing to think, De Spain heard Pardaloes meas ured tread on the descending steps, and listened mechanically to the re treating echoes of his footsteps down the shaded street. Minute after min ute passed. De Spain made no move. A step so light that It could only have been the step of a delicate girlhood, a step free as the footfall of youth, poised as the tread of womanhood and beauty, came down the stairs. Slight as she was, and silent as he was, she walked straight to him ln the dark ness, and, sinking between his feet, wound her hands through his two arms. I heard everything, Henry, she murmured, looking up. An Invol untary start of protest was his only response. I was afraid of a plot against you. I stayed at the hend of the stairs. Henry, I told you long ago some dreadful thing would come be tween ussomething not our fault. And now It comes to dash our cup of happiness when It Is filling. She stopped, hoping perhaps lie would sny some little word, that lie would even pat her head, or press her hand, but he sat Uke one stunned. If It could have been anything but this! she pleaded, low and sorrowfully. Oh, why did you not listen to me before we were engulfed! My dear Henry! You whove given me all the happiness I have ever hadthat the blood of my own should come against you and yours! The emotion she struggled with, and fought back with all tho strength of her nature,- rose ln a re sistless tide that swept her on, ln the face of.Jds ominous silence, to despair. Her breath, no longer controlled, came brokenly, and her voice trembled. You have been very kind to me, Henryyouve been the only man Ive ever known that always, everywhere, thought of me first I told you I didnt deserve It, I wasnt worthy of It His hands slipped silently over her hands. He gathered her close Into his arms, and hts tears fell on her up turned face. TO BE CONTINUED."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["north"], "snippet": "years ng6.

But all of them put together do not equal in number or speed, or power to hunt down, the great kennel ot hounds ot which Sin and Trouble are owner and master. Bnt what Is a relief forall this pursuit ot trouble, and annoyance, and pain, and be reavement?

Hto comfort, wby it embosoms all distress. Hls arm, it wrenches off aU bondage. Hls hand, It wipes away all tears. His Obrlstly atone ment, It makes us all right with the past, and all right with the future all right with God, all right with man, and all right for ever. Lamartine tells us tbat King Nimrod said to hls three sons, Hero aro three yokes, and one is ot clay, another of amber, and another ot gold. Choose now which yon will have. The eldest son, having first ohoice, chose the vase of gold, on whloh was written the word Empire, and when opened it was found to contain human blood. The second son, making tho next, choice, ohose the vase ot aml0r.Jns with the 1 nuTwM f openod I  jUma the ashes of these who were Called great. The third son took tho of clay, and, oponing It, found it _ ptv bat on the bottom of it was in- scrlral the name ot God. King Nimrod asked bis oourtlers whloh vase they thought weghed the most. The avaricious men ot hiseourt said the vase of gold. The poets said the one of amber. But tho wisest men said the empty vase, because ono letter ot the name of God outwoighed a universe. For Him I thirst for Hte gram I beg on Hls promise I build my all. Without Him I cannot be happy. I have tried the world, and it does well enough as far it goes, but It Is too uncertain a world, too evanescent a world. I am not a prejudiced witness. I have nothing against this world. I have been one of the most fortunate, or to use a more Christian word, one of the most blessed of menblessed in my parents, blessed ln the place of my nativity, blessed In my health, blessed ln my field of work, blessed in my natural temperament, blessed In my family, blessed in my opportunities, blessed in a comfortable livelihood, blessed In the ho,e that my soul will go to Heaven through the pardoning mercy ot God, and niy body, unless it be lost at sea or cre mated in some conflagration, will He down ln the gardens of Groenwood among my kindred and friends, some already gone and others to come after me. Life to many has been n disappointment, bnt to me It bas been a pleasant surprise, and yet I de clare that It I did not feel tbat God was now my Friend and ever-present help, I should be wretched and t error at icken. But I want more of Him. I have thought over this text aud preached this sermon to myself until with all the arouse.l energies of my body, mind and soul, I can ory out, As tbe liart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Theo, O God. Ob, when some of yon get there it will be like what a hunter tells of when push ing his eanoe far up North ln the winter and amid the Ice-floes, and a hundred miles, as he thought, from any other human be ings! He was startled ono day as he heard astepplng on the ice, and he cocked his rifle ready to meet unythlng that came near. He found a man, barefooted and In sane from long exposure, approaching him. Taking him into bis canoe and kindling fires to warm him, he restored him and found out where be had lived, and took him to hls home, and found all the village ln great excitement. A hundred men were searching for the lost man, and bis family and friends rushed out to meet him and, as had been agreed at hls first appearance, bells were rung, and guns were fired, and banquets spread, and the rescuer loaded with presents.

Foster. Mr. Goad was wounded four times in the affray with the Allens, and bullets from his revolver broke Floyd Allens leg, and also injured Sidna Allen. The witness was asked why he was armed with two pistols on the day of the affray. Counsel for jthe defense ob jected, on the ground that testimony elicited by this question would he hear-say or a mere expression oi opinion. After brief argument by Mr. Draper, for the state, and Mr. Willis, for the defense, the question was with drawn. On recross-examination by Judge Hairston, for the defense, Mr. Goad said that after the shooting he step ped into the clerks office and reloaded his automatic pistol, but made no at tempt to use it again. This pistol shoots eight or nine times with one loading. The next witness was J. M. Beville, 66 years old, wearing a checked jump er under his coat and striped trousers, and with long iron gray chin whiskers. He lives two miles from Floyd Allen. He has been friendly with him. He met Floyd Allen on the road between their two houses some time before the trial. Allen said he was sorry he had got into the trouble with the boys he wished he had just let the boys go to jail. Now he was in it, he would submit to anything they put on him In the way of fine, but if they tried to put him in the penitentiary he would make a hole in the courthouse, and if Judge Bolen his counsel didnt do his duty he would be plied up with the rest of them. Witness said Mr. Allen, I hope you wont get into no such a thing as that. Cross-ex amined by Mr. Willis, the witness said he had often borrowed money from Floyd Allen, but always paid him. He denied that Floyd Allen holds a note of his for borrowed money. Judge Bolen Testifies. Judge Bolen, of Carroll, was put on the stand and he practically confirm ed Bevilles account of his transactions with Floyd Allen, showing that it is a matter of 9, involving some ques tions over a sale of land for parti tion. Sidney Spraker, 22 years old, a well- dressed young farmer, said he lived near Hillsville and works for Mr. Wil kinson. He was in the courtroom at Hillsville the day before the shooting, when the jury in Floyd Allens trial was out and was expected to return. Floyd Allen came to the stove, on the north side of the room, where witness was, as if to warm himself. Claude Allen walked up to Floyd, reached out and took hold of his hand and said Let me feel your pulse, old man. After about three seconds Claude dropped Floyds hand and said Its heating regular. Floyd Allen asked, in a sort of whisper Are all the hoys ready? Witness did not hear the reply. Floyd then walked across to near the door of the judges room and stood on a bench. W. D. Tompkins, a well-known law yer of the Carroll bar, another eyd wit ness, was next examined. His office is directly across the street from the courthouse. He did not know the ver dict in the Allen case had been given and went into court to attend to legal business. He exchanged a few words on a matter with the judge, then con ferred briefly with Mr. Tipton, also of the local bar, and handed him a paper on which to indorse an excep tion. Witness stepped outside the bar, and, facing Mr. Tipton and the Judge, waited for the indorsement.
