He has committed himself to collect for the Cancer Crusade, which will kick off in Appomattox County next month. Jamerson will use an Amigo battery-powered vehicle to make his rounds during the cancer-fund drive. The 78-pound, 18-inch-side vehicle will be a common sight the next few weeks around Walton Place, where Jamerson and his wife, Vicky live, and where Bob has agreed to collect for the cancer drive. While the Amigo may not ever show up in the Indy 500 - - its speed hovers around 3 miles per hour - - it is nonetheless a reliable source of transportation. Ive always wanted to do something like this, says Jamerson. yhen I was young, I always wanted a paper route. This vehicle is nice because it gives me the mobility to get around, and collect for the cancer crusade. Jamerson will be one of 50 volunteers collecting in the Appomat tox area..

At latest reports, two other occu pants of the death car were still un conscious and in a very critical con dition at a Lynchburg hospital. They are Carl Bryant, 19, and Calvin Phelps, 28, both of Route 2, Gladstone. It is understood that Bryant and Phelps have fractures of the skull and leg. The death car plunged over the left side of Route 26, dopvn an em bankment and literally wrapped it self around a tree. The ear jack knifed, badly mangling the victims. After the car was prized from the tree, and brought to Appomattox Sunday morning, large crowds gath ered all during the day to view the wreckage. Other crowds drove to the wreck site on Route 26. State Police who investigated the crash, declared that high speed was the obvious cause of the wreck. These deaths started Appomattox County off into 1955 with no chance of bettering its 1954 highway death toll. Last vear there was only one highway death in the county, and that, too, occurred in January.
