Invalid infancy followed by some crippling accident or dimness of eye sight or dullness of hearing or privation or disaster or unfortunateenvironment makes life a perpetual winter. But in most lives there is a period of summer, although it may be a short summer, and that is the time to provide for the future. One of the best ways of insuring the fu ture is to put aside all you can for charit able provision. You put a crumbling stone in the foundation of your fortune if you do not in your plans regard the sufferings tint you may alleviate. You will have tne pledge of the high heavens for your tem poral welfare when you help the helpless, for the promise is Blessed is he that con- sidereth the poor -the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. Then there is another way of providing for the future. If you have 31000 a year income, save 100 or 2000 a year, save  500  or  3000 , save  1000 . Do you say such economy is meanness? I say it is a vaster meanness for you to make no pro vision for the future and compel your friends or the world to take care of you or yours in case of bereavement or calam- ity. There are women who at the first in crease of their husbands resources wreck all on an extravagant wardrobe. There are men who at the prospect of larger prosperity build houses they will never be able to pay for. There are people with -4000 a year income who have not one dol lar laid up for a rainy day. It is a ghastly dishonesty practiced on the next genera tion. Such men deserve bankruptcy and -impoverishment. In almost every mans life there comes a winter of cold misfor tune. Prepare for it while you may. Whose thermometer has not sometimes stood below zero? What ship has never been caught in a storm? What regiment atthe front never got into a battle? Have at least as much foresight as the insectile world. Examine the pantries of the ant hills i.i this weather, and you will find that last summers supply is not yet exhausted. Ex amine them next July and you will find them being replenished. Go to the ant, thou sluggard. Consider her ways and be wise, which, having no guide, overseer or ruler, proviaeth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest. This is no argument for miserliness. Avarice and penuriousness destroy a man about as soon as any of the other vices. .We have heard of those who entered their iron money vault for business purposes, and the door accidentally shut, ana they were suffocated, their corpse not discov ered until the next day. But every day and all up and down the streets of our cities iher_are men, body, mind and soul, forever fust In their own money vaults Accumulation of bonds, mortgages and Government securities and town Jots and big farms just for the pleasure of accumu lation is despicable, but the putting aside of a surplus for your self defense when your bram has halted, or your right hand has forgotten its cunning, or your old age needs a manservant, or for the support of others when you can no more be a bread winner for your householdthat is right, that is beautiful, that is Christian, that is divinely approved. That shows that you have taken Solomiins ant hill for an ob ject lesson. Goim out of this world with out leaving a dollar for those who remain behind, if you have done your beat, yon have a right to put your head in calm con fidence on the pillow which Jeremiah shook np in the forty-ninth chapter of hit proDhecv.

You can pass on ideas without believing them yourself though they wont be very con vincing but you cant pass on faith you dont have yourself, But there are two ways in which people, who do have some genuine personal religious faith, try to share it, without success. One wrong way is to try to force it on other people. In the Middle Ages the church used to conduct some strange evangelistic campaigns. They would get the police to round up a dozen or so Jews, the Jews would be tied together and taken to church and made to listen to Christian preaching for a number of Sundays, and then they would take those Jews out and dunk them in the fountain in the public square, by way of Christian baptism. Then they would chalk it up in their stat istics  so many Jews convert ed this year. No, there were no converts by that route.

Having once gone through the agony of giving up for a year to the other man a certain part of our Income, while the conval escence may be slow, the acute pain Is over. From that time we are cus todians of the Lords money, our duty Deing simply to hand it out. With other causes, apparently of equal worth, we have nothing to do, unless our income is suddenly Increased. Otherwise we are immune. Some other person must take care of them. If we have given all we can In the deacons fund compartment, when a hard luck story comes to our door, without a twinge of remorse we can send the applicant to a deacons care. 3. Comprehension. Every one giv ing means every one Interested. Great causes being more frequently and regularly before you,you will want to know more about your frequent In vestment. A once a year advertise ment Is good. A once a week adver tisement that your responsibilities and privileges are unbounded makes meaningful your prayer. Thy king dom come on earth. 4. Consecutiveness. Annual col lections are variable as the weather nnd the state of the general health. They can be and are annually dodged by otherwise regular worshipers. The double envelope Is a faithful re minder to those ill, out of town, or otherwise absent one Sunday that their gifts will be expected by the Great Head of the Church just the same. The sinews for the war against sin should not depend upon the clouds, nor the emotional result from either a poor presentation of a good cause or a fine presentation of a poor cause.  5. Convenience. Most people are paid monthly or weekly. The woman i who could not give 25 in a lump sum could easily give fifty cents fifty- two times a year. One dollar comes harder than ten cents a week. In a year, it is only one-fifth as much to the cause. If the home church de pended upon annual collections for Its support it would be dead. Only the inherent energy of mis sions keeps missions alive during these weary annual offering years. While the board knows that a church will give, because its foreign mis sion Sunday comes at the end of the year, while foreign mission expenses go on all through the year, good money goes for interest on borrowed capital to supply this deficiency. Christ confronts every Christian with send or go! Your money or your life! Your money is your lifes expression. Our rendering per head for running expenses is six times that of our gift to God.

Hto comfort, wby it embosoms all distress. Hls arm, it wrenches off aU bondage. Hls hand, It wipes away all tears. His Obrlstly atone ment, It makes us all right with the past, and all right with the future all right with God, all right with man, and all right for ever. Lamartine tells us tbat King Nimrod said to hls three sons, Hero aro three yokes, and one is ot clay, another of amber, and another ot gold. Choose now which yon will have. The eldest son, having first ohoice, chose the vase of gold, on whloh was written the word Empire, and when opened it was found to contain human blood. The second son, making tho next, choice, ohose the vase ot aml0r.Jns with the 1 nuTwM f openod I  jUma the ashes of these who were Called great. The third son took tho of clay, and, oponing It, found it _ ptv bat on the bottom of it was in- scrlral the name ot God. King Nimrod asked bis oourtlers whloh vase they thought weghed the most. The avaricious men ot hiseourt said the vase of gold. The poets said the one of amber. But tho wisest men said the empty vase, because ono letter ot the name of God outwoighed a universe. For Him I thirst for Hte gram I beg on Hls promise I build my all. Without Him I cannot be happy. I have tried the world, and it does well enough as far it goes, but It Is too uncertain a world, too evanescent a world. I am not a prejudiced witness. I have nothing against this world. I have been one of the most fortunate, or to use a more Christian word, one of the most blessed of menblessed in my parents, blessed ln the place of my nativity, blessed In my health, blessed ln my field of work, blessed in my natural temperament, blessed In my family, blessed in my opportunities, blessed in a comfortable livelihood, blessed In the ho,e that my soul will go to Heaven through the pardoning mercy ot God, and niy body, unless it be lost at sea or cre mated in some conflagration, will He down ln the gardens of Groenwood among my kindred and friends, some already gone and others to come after me. Life to many has been n disappointment, bnt to me It bas been a pleasant surprise, and yet I de clare that It I did not feel tbat God was now my Friend and ever-present help, I should be wretched and t error at icken. But I want more of Him. I have thought over this text aud preached this sermon to myself until with all the arouse.l energies of my body, mind and soul, I can ory out, As tbe liart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Theo, O God. Ob, when some of yon get there it will be like what a hunter tells of when push ing his eanoe far up North ln the winter and amid the Ice-floes, and a hundred miles, as he thought, from any other human be ings! He was startled ono day as he heard astepplng on the ice, and he cocked his rifle ready to meet unythlng that came near. He found a man, barefooted and In sane from long exposure, approaching him. Taking him into bis canoe and kindling fires to warm him, he restored him and found out where be had lived, and took him to hls home, and found all the village ln great excitement. A hundred men were searching for the lost man, and bis family and friends rushed out to meet him and, as had been agreed at hls first appearance, bells were rung, and guns were fired, and banquets spread, and the rescuer loaded with presents. Well, when some ot yon step oat of this wilderness, where yon have been chilled and torn ag sometimes lost amid the Iceberg warm greetings of all tbe villages  th e glorified, and your friends rush o u t to give you weleomlng kiss, the news that th e r e to another soul forever saved will c all th e caterers ot Heaven to spread tho banquet and the bell-men to lay hold of the ro p e in the tower, and while tbe ehallees eliek at the feast, and the bells clang from the tur rets, it will be a scene so uplifting I p ra y God I may be there to take part in th e celestial merriment. Until tbe d a y break and the shadows flee away, be th o u like a roe or a young hart upon the mouse tains of Bether."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Christian"], "snippet": "to use a more <mark>Christian</mark> word, one of the"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Christian"], "snippet": "to use a more <mark>Christian</mark> word, one of the"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

I. And 8amuel spake . . say ing, vv. 3-8. It is possible that at times Samuel was a fugitive, but that he was praying, teaching and preach ing the word of Jehovah we are as sured. At last Israel was drawn to gether, v. 2 R. V. margin. Undoubted ly 8amnels pure life and his faithful witnessing had aa much to do with this assembling as did the oppression of the Philistines. Samuel told the people plainly that ta order to bo de livered from tbe Philistines Israel most return unto Jehovah with all your heart The putting away judg ing of sin and all idols Is the first step of any real, genuine repentance towards God, Isa. 567. When Israel adopted Asbteroth and the strange tods they possibly did so with ao thought of forsaking Jehovah, but rather with the Idea of enrteehlng their worship. Such liberality, aich a federation of religions Is weakening to tbe cause of faith, Matt 624,1 John 215, James, 44. Samuel might bn called narrow bnt bis exhortation to Israel that Inc, return to tbe love and, worship ,ehovah, to the obedi ence tof hts laVi with whole-souled de votion, was the.flrst, and tho most es sential requisite to their freedom. 18 reels response v. 4 meant not alone self-denial, bnt n revolt against tbe Philistines. This meant also tbe giv ing np of amnsementsand profits which might accompany such worship. The word heart includes the will, affec tions, motives and powers of tool. Not merely a surface emotion, bnt a deep change of heart and character. It Is sad to recall that this wfcs a reformation, not n regeneration oh. 88, but such In the history of. M, emotional reformation. One day, how ever, we shall sae that one win Inst last Rom. 1126. Samuel Is a type ol Christ as a prophet and .also as aa intercessor, Hob. 726. Gathering the people at Mlzpah a lookout ha caused the people to look to God. 8uch a gathering was an evidence of that unity of the people of God which must over precede prevailing prayer, Ps. 996, Heb. 1026. The meeting began by a prayer by Samuel who was nearest to God. They than poured out water upon tbe ground, a symbol of their utter - helplessness, also of the pouring ont of their hearts before God, n Sam. 1414 Ps. 688. Israel also fasted  an expression of sod row for sin which was so deep that they could not eat and a sign of the humiliation of self and aa earnest de sire to find God, Dan. 98, Acts 182, 8. They made confession of sin, there was no boasting of virtue, Ps. 614. II. And Samuel offered s burnt offering, w . 812. Twenty years of bondage bred a spirit of tsar in the hearts of tho Israelites and te their extremity they turned to Sam uel to intercede for them., Christian have a better one as their interces sor, I John 21 Heb. 726 Rom. 834. Israel no longer places Its trust te an ontward symbol as wb formerly they sent for the ark, oh. 48. All real prayer is preceded by sacri fice, and the only ground we have upon which to approach a holy God Is to shed blood, Heb. 1019, John 146. This ta also a typo of entire consecration. The lamb of Samuels sacrifice is type of our Christ who entered into Gods presence for ns by his own blood, Heb. 911, 12. Having thus properly approached God, Samuel cried for Israel, and the Lord hoard him, John 179. In the midst of this the Philistines gave battle v. 10 even as Satan often makes his fiercest assaults upon ua in the midst of our holiest exercises. God thun dered with a great voice, v. 11, marg., bringing discomfiture and fear to tho enemy, I John 514. No voice of Is rael could have effected such results but the voice of God In response to the prayers of a godly man brought victory, James 616. Both secular and sacred history record Instances where God used the elements to deliver his praying people. The storm which de stroyed tbe Spanish armada and saved England the unusual winds and tides which saved Leyden came in con nection with the most earnest prayers, see also III Kings 1935. In this we see a fulfillment of Hannahs prophecy, ch. 210, In our last lesson Israel was defeated, 410, now they pursue the Philistines as far as Beth-car and Shen, an unknown place west of Mis- peh. Between the latter and Mlzpeh, Samuel erected a memorial pillar and called it Ebenezer, tbe Stone ol Help, where 20 years previous Is rael had suffered defeat and the ark of God was captured. So this stone was a twofold monument of a vic tory, and also of deliverance from 20 years of bondage. Ever and anon the church has cause to set up its Ebenezers for new deliverances. Per ecu tion and corruption have not yet prevailed against the true church at God, Matt 1618. The Hesrt of the Lesson. This lea- son Is a great revelation of the power and effectiveness of intercessory prayer. Moses and Aaron among hia priests, and Samnel among them that call upon his name, Ps. 996, seems to place Samuel at the head of to rads intercessors even as Mosss sad Aaron led the prophet priest."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Christian"], "snippet": "to intercede for them., <mark>Christian</mark> have a better one"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Christian"], "snippet": "to intercede for them., <mark>Christian</mark> have a better one"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

BENNETT Nc unfinished nwers \u00f3r un won wars with God In Lukes Gospel, chapter 1428-82, Jesus illustrated the common problem of iinfinithedi business with two brief parables the parable of - an impulsive farmer who began to build an elaborate farm-building but did not finirii due to a lack of funds the parable of  a rash king who declared, war on a nation but did not win due to a tack of soldiers and military power. Unfinished business is the obvious problem in these parables, but what of the application to your life and mine? Traditionally, we have applied these parables to the Christian experience, saying that anyone who follows after Jesus Christ should first count the cost of that diseipleship. And this seems to be the obvious application since Jesus Him self said likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannotbe my disciple. However, there might be another application which isnt so obvious. When Jesus spoke these parables, the inevitability of the Cross loomed large on the horikon. Jesus has begun to tell the disciples of His impending suffering and death and no doubt, He knew what the immediate reaction would be from the disciples as they witnessed His death. They would be frightened, puzzl ed, disappointed, and dis illusioned, and ask ques tions lik\u00e9 Was Jesus really the Messiah, and if so, why did He die . . . Does this mean the actually death of God Himself? So. then, Jesus, who knew how these men would view the Cross, seems to be suggesting to them with these parables that there is no unfinished business,, no unfinished towers, and no unwon wars with God - the Cross would not mean the defeat of Gad and His Kingdom of right eousness.

People are tired of meanness, they are sick of being lied to and  cheated. They are I tired of the sins of  others, even tired I of their own. So if a  really good person should appear, one I in whom was no I shadow, completely j t r a n s p a r e n t to  the Eternal Light, Dr. Foreman  wouldnt everyone I flock to him, wouldnt he have the I human race in the palm of his  hand, as it were, in a short time?     Agelong War I HE ANSWER is No. It is not well f  to be too optimistic about human I nature! As a matter of fact, some I of the best persons history has R known met some of the bitterest  opposition. Indeed, when One came I who was completely good, whose life was all light and no shadow, he was no better treated and no more warmly welcomed than less good persons have been. Jesus Christ had his enemies, strong and well-organized. The number of those who believed in him was comparatively small the number who did not believe or ignored him al together, was enormous. The history of mankind is the history of a war, the age long war between good and evil, between God and his enemies. The story of Jesus is one chapter in this his tory, the most important by far, but by no means the first one or the last.     Why Was Jesus Hated? I jHE READER should examine   the record in the Gospels and I try to think for himself who opposed I Jesus, and why they did so. One I striking fact is that Jesus enemies I were not what we call the lower I classes, much less the criminal I classes. His enemies were rather I from out of the top drawer, as we I might say. They were the financial I social and religious leaders of his I time. They finally got him executed I as a criminal. If there had never been any 9 one to contradict the records of the Sanhedrin, that high court of Jerusalem, and those records had become recognized as the truth, Jesus would have gone down in history, if re membered at all, as a trouble maker, a lawless and worthless man, whose execution was a protection to society. Why were these leading men, I Jesus distinguished contempo- I raries, so wrong about Jesus?    I As he is, so are we . . I THE READER should think this I  out for himself. One reason can I be mentioned here It is very easy I for wrong to be so long accepted I and so strongly entrenched that  it is universally taken for right.  Then when the right comes along, I especially when in the form of an I idea suggested by some one not of I the upper crust, it actually seems 1 to be wrong. People kept long in B a dark room find light painful! S Any one who tries to follow Jesus will find himself up against the same sort of op position. 9 Any one who proposes to live as  Jesus lived, or to change our ac- I customed patterns of society in the I direction which Jesus pointed out,  will be called as he was a crack- la pot, a dreamer, an impractical fel- , j low who does not know enough to  go in when it rains.    1 Our Divine Alliance I ONSIDER one example of this.   - r A Christian who makes up his  mind to dedicate his body a living  sacrifice to God, and therefore not  to handicap himself with the drug I of alcohol, is certain, in many I places, to be considered a sort of  crank. It is not that people will  laugh at him, though they will  people will be angry with him for  his stand. They will do all they  can to make him break his pledge. Instead of admiring a clean and free life, many people are I not content unless they can soil that cleanness and break down that freedom. So to stand for Christ in any aspect of life Is not easy. But we need to remember we fight no lonely fight our cause is not forlorn. Just as Jesus in Galilee was al- igways on the side of those who were beaten and battered by sin and j . evil, but still fighting, so now the Sever-living Christ is always on the side of those who in their hearts .--desire good and not evil, cleanness!

Y .Preaching at the Irving Square Presbyterian Church on the theme, The Life Spiritual in Christ the Fundamental in Chris tianity, the Rev. Ira Wemmell Hen derson, pastor, took as his text John 35 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. He said It is my desire, as the Spirit may give me wisdom, to unfold to you what, to my mind, is the fundamental in Christianity. From the words of our Master I conceive the truth to be that, save as we apprehend the spiritual verities revealed in Jesus Christ save as -e see the world, man, our God, with the spiritual vis ion, we cannot become partakers of the glories of the kingdom of our Father. Only as we open our hearts and minds to the indwelling Spirit of Almighty God do we enter into the promised land of the new dispensa tion, to possess it, to enjoy it. Filled with the Spirit we, live, but if the Spirit of God abide not in a man he Is none of His. In that beautiful figure of the vine Christ cuts clear for us the nature of the spiritual life. It is our oneness within the Author of the universe and of us. It is the merging of our lives Into the life of God. The perfect spiritual life expresses itself in union within the Maker. Entirely within the lining Christ moves the flawless human. Fashion a man according to the stature of Jesus Christ and you have a spiritual man. The spiritual life is that life within Christ which will make you always ask, What would Jesus do? The ethical judg ment always referring for its sanction to the spiritual. Spirituality and godliness are syn onymous. Apart, from the glorified Nazarene there is, Christianly speak ing. no spiritual existence. Spiritual ity is no mere statement of philoso phy it is a fact. A vital and a vivi fying reality Is the life within the Son of Man. The Christ, life is not merely a state of mind, but a mode of action. The living of the man within Jesus and for the Father, and the Holy Spirit dwelling in him, that Is the life spiritual. As the late Or. plaltbie D. Babcock well said  Spir ituality is seeing God in common things and showing God in common things. Now this spiritual life is not eso teric in its nature. It Is not a life for the few. It is a life for us alt. The economy of the good news of the Master is worldwide in its application and inclusiveness. To all men the opportunity to dwell within Christ is offered. To ail the higher life has its appeal. From Nlcodemus of the San hedrim, to Oneslmua the slave. From the mighty in intellect, to the unlet tered and unlearned.

In many communities it has come to be the custom to select the Man of the Year or the Wom an of the Year, the idea usually being to name the person, through a process of sampling of pub lic opinion, who has rendered the out standing service of the year. Sundays lesson is a dramatic scene out of the long ago, picturing a com munitys tribute to a truly great man, the apostle Paul. Read Acts 2017-38, and you will have the story.   LOVED AND HONORED T HE first impression I get from this story is the fact that these people of Ephesus loved Paul. They loved him enough to lay aside their work and hasten to the near by seaport of Miletus to see him for the last time, and to bow down in his presence and honor him. Why did they thus love Paul? Because he had told them about God. You need but read again the record of Pauls ministry in that important city of Ephesus to be reminded of how greatly he had served them in the name of Jesus. Loved and honored! What a trib ute to the worth of Christian char acter! Wouldnt you appreciate the tribute which they paid Paul as the goal out yonder to which you strive? Boys and girls of today may thus be honored tomorrow, if they will live for Jesus as Paul did.    THE POWER OF RIGHT LIVING P AUL not only told the Ephesians  how to live, but illustrated day by day in his own life what he preached to them. The most elo quent sermons are not spoken, but lived. What you are speaks so loud ly I cant hear what you say. The boy and man who plays the game straight are putting into practice what the teacher and preacher proclaims on Sunday. The power of right living will win its way today, just as it did in the long ago when Paul witnessed for Jesus in Ephesus. It was not easy to live for Christ in Ephesus, nor is it easy to live for him in Chicago or Los Angeles or Boston or Miami, but it is the one way to ultiijiately impress the world of the reality of Christianity.    PAULS CONSUMING PASSION W E ARE what we are becoming, and never was this axiom of life more powerfully illustrated than in the case of Paul. I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus, Philippians 314. And in Ephesians 56-21, Paul reviews the qualities of conduct which produce worthwhile character, admonishing all Chris tians to strive for these qualities. 1 live, yet not I, Christ liveth in me, is -another of Pauls watchwords, and still again, I can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth me. It was the consuming passion of his life to embody the teachings of Christ in his words and in his works. It is conceivable that the people at Ephesus had come to see Christ in the life of Paul, and that his daily ministry in their midst convinced them that God was in Christ recon ciling the world unto himself.    WHAT AM I WORTH? HpHE question then emerges, What am I worth to my com munity? When I come to the end of the journey, will the people who know me best honor and love me for what I have done? I can see the people of Ephesns bowing on the dock at Miletus, kissing this weary old servant of the Lord. It is a beautiful scene. This tribute meant more to Paul than all the gold of Ephesus would have meant. It was compensation of abiding worth to him. And what is vastly more important, it was glory to God which must have evoked the praise of the angels about the great White Throne.

Another defeat of Oblivion Will be found in the character of those whom we rescue, uplift or srfve. Character is eter nal. Suppose by a right influence we aid in transforming a bad man into a good man, a dolorous man into a happy man, a disheartened man into a courageous man, every stroke of that work done will be im mortalized. There may never be so much as one line in a newspaper regarding it or no mortal tongue may ever whisper it into human ear, but wherever that soul shall go your work upon it shall go, wherever that soul rises your work ont it will rise, and so long as that soul will last your work on it will last.

There is another and1 a more complete defeat for oblivion, and that is in the heart of God Himself. You have seen a sailor roll up his sleeve and show you his iarm tattooed with the figure of a favonto ship, perhaps the first one in which he lever sailed.. You have seen a soldier roll up his sleeve and show his arm tattooed with the figure of a fortress where he was garrisoned or the face of a great general under whom he fought.  You have seen many a hand tattooed with the face of a loved one before or after marriage. This .custom of tattooing is almost as old as the world.. It is some colored liquid punc tured into the flesh so indelibly that noth ing can wash it out. It may have been there fifty years, but when the man goes jinto his coffin that picture will go with him on hand or arm. Now, God says that He has tattooed us upon His hands.

It appears that Tucker was slain on the back porch of the residence in Evergreen in which he and his wife, her mother, and her brother, May berry lived. This shooting apparently occurred sometime after 10 oclock Friday night. Called to the scene from his home in Appomattox, Dr. Christian was on an errand of mercy. From a re construction of the events, it appears that the popular young doctor was shot as he approached the door of the -house. Christians body was found on the walk to the house, and removed only after a terriffic gun battle between the posse and Mayberry. Nearly two hours passed between the shooting of Tucker and the flni arrest, of May- berry- Mayberry was Yelled by a shotgun blast near a garage hide out from which he had fired from 30 to 50 shots from a pistol and a shotgun at the surrounding officers. Mayberry was given medical treat ment here and sent to Rlctnond Saturday morning. His wounds are said not to be serious. The midnight sounding of sirens and the use oi flares to light up the scene attracted the attention of a sizeable gathering of spectators and details of the tragedy have been the topic of interest here since. Funeral services for the victims were held Monday. Serviced for Mr. Tucker were conducted from the Evergreen Baptist Chunch, by the pastor, the Rev. D. L. Bailey. Mili tary services were conducted by the grave by American Legion Post 104. Burial was in the Evergreen Ceme tery. Funeral services for Dr.Christlan were held here Monday at 11 A. M., from Appomattox Court House Pres byterian Church, conducted by his pastor, Dr. Twyman Williams, as sisted by Dr. C. A. Collins, Jr., and the Rev. B. T. Price. A great concourse of friends gath ered for the services. An outpour ing of floral tributes and messages of condolence bore testimony to the esteem in which th1 young physician and his family are held. Son of Dr. D. A. Christian, Jr. the physician began his practice here following service in the Navy during World War II. He occupied the office his father had used for a generation of service to the people of this area. Affectionay known as Young Doctor David, he endeared himself to the public by his skill as a physician and the charm of his personality. He was serving as a member of the Appo mattox Town Council and recently organized a group here to further the cause of physical education at the Appomattox school. As a mark of respect, local busi ness places closed during the funeral hour. A movement has begun to have an appropriate memorial in his hon or.

Any attentive reader of the Psalms will find that they, Uke all the Bible for that matter, look both ways  toward God in worship and to ward this life with its tasks and troubles. Each of the Psalms chosen for this week combines these two sides of religion. Take the First Psalm as a prime ex ample. At first glance it seems to be all about man. It de scribes two kinds of men, good and bad. The good man is com pared to a great tree by a river side the bad man is like the chaff blown from the threshing floor on the hill. From the first verse to the last, attention is focused on these two men, the tree-man and the rubbish-man. And yet a second glance will show a third Person in the pic ture the LORD. The two men ar\u00e9 examined and judged in ref erence to God,in reference to their relation to God and to His will. Isnt it true that we often judge men withouth thought of God? Isnt it true that we often judge other things, events in na ture and in the human world, without ever a thought of God? The Psalm suggests that what ever we look at can be seen more truly if we see it in the light of God. Life If the first Psalm observes conduct in the atmosphere and light of religious faith and wor ship, the 15th Psalm observes a worshipping man in the light of his conduct. The main point of Psalm 15 is characteristic of both Old and New Testaments You cant worship God aright if you are the wrong kind of per son. You cant disobey and dis regard God six days a week and make it up by going to church on the seventh day. Worshippers with what the Psalmist would call dirty hands get nowhere with God. Some of the most se vere denunciations in the Bible are against those who make a specialty of worship but have forgotten to be just to their fel low men. The story of Cain is a notable example. Cain and Abel brought sacrifices to the same God God did not accept the sacrifice of Cain  why? He was not the kind of man whose sacrifices would be ac ceptable. The Place of Beauty So true worship and right liv ing blend into and support each other. But there is another point the Psalms suggest. The Psalms are poems, and much beauty is in them. Is beauty something the good man should fear or despise as some good men have thought, or is beauty re lated both to worship and to life? If we follow the guidance of the Psalms, we shall find that beauty, so far from being a mere decoration, is a support to both sides of religion. Beauty is not a substitute for either wor ship or conduct, yet it has a high place in both. How would the Psalms sound if all their beauty were ironed out flat in unimaginative prose! How ixnat tractive is a good life that has no beauty in it! Right living is an art rather than a science and so beauty of spirit is even more attractive, in the long run, than beauty of form. If you made a list of die people you love and admire most, are the persons at the top of the list the most handsome?

The same thing can be said about re ligion. Let me write a churchs hymnbook, and I care not who writes their theologies. The hymns our mothers loved, the hymns we heard before we heard any other kind of poetry, the hymns that we have learned by heart and that become a part of our minds these mean far more to most peo ple than all the printed creeds. Now the Christian religion is a singing religion. Our very first hymnbook was the Book of Psalms, and all the hymnals since, down to the present day, grew out of this one book in the Bible. It is the greatest hymn book in the world not the long est nor. the oldest, but the great est in its influence for good upon mankind.    I Poetry Was in Jesus Blood  F OUR Lord Jesus himself, it truly can be said, poetry was in his veins. He came of a poetic family. His most famous ancestor, David, was a poet another royal ancestor, Hezekiah, wrote poetry. The book he knew best, the Old Testament, was full of poetry. His own mother Mary, before he was born, sang a song of her own mak ing, so beautiful that it is still sung in Christian churches and loved the world around. - When Jesus died on the cross, two of the last seven sentences that came from his lips were quotations from the Psalms. The poetry of his people was in his blood, for in his last agony the i words that came from his break ing heart were words first spok- I en by the poets of the Bible long , ago. j So it is always. Truth in song I will tarry long. Today and al-  ways, the parts of the Bible which  are most cherished, the parts most i often learned by heart, the parts  which we carry with us to the val- 1 ley of the shadow of death, are the truths set to music, long centuries ago, by inspired men who knew how to clothe truth with garments of shining and immortal loveliness, j Copyright by tbo InternationaI Council ol I Roligioua Education on boball ol 0 Proton- taut doMomiaatiooM.
