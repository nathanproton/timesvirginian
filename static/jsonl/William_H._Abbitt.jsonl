The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Mrs. Nowlin went out on the porch and gave the alarm, and requested Constable N. W. Owen to arrest Mr. Nowlin, say ing that be had twice shot at her. Heury, a sou of Mr. Nowlin, came up, and went in search of his lather. He found him behind an outhouse. Mr. Nowlin said to him  Get my horse. I want you to carry me to Spout Spring. He spoke so ration ally that the young mau left him to go to the field and take a horse from the plow for bis fathers use in go ing to Spout Spring. Before leav ing his father, Heury tequested him to give up the pistol which he had concealed on his person. Mr. Now lin was searched, but no pistol was found. His son had proceeded ouly a few steps when Mr. Nowlin sent u bullet through his own brain. He eeled aud fell, and died within 30 minutes. The bullet entered his left temple and came out just above his right car. Diligent inquiry has not developed any cause whatever for the rasl. act of Mr. Nowlin, and, al though he was of a despondent dis position and very high-tempered, he had never had an attack that made him the mudmau he was on Friday. Those nearest to him claim that he was evidently cruzy, aud that is the general verdict of the people. He nad for years beeen a great sufferer from ueuralgia and his bodily health was generally rather infirm. Borne reports say that Mr. Nowlin became enraged at a negro servant on the place, and had no occasion to be an gry with his wife, who is one of the best ladies in our county. It is one of the saddest affairs that ever hap pened in this county, as the family upon both sides is well known and highly connected. The deceased was born about 62 years ago in the house in which he was piepared for burial. He was not a member of any church. While he was high-tempered and courageous, he had a warm heart, full of sympathy. He had beeu a merchant and postmaster at Oak ville most of his life, but was engaged in farming at the. time of his death. Besides his wife, who was a Miss Woodson, Mr. Now lin leaves six children. He is also survived by two brothers and two sisters Mr. S. Walker Nowlin, of Lynchburg Mr. William S. Nowlin, of Spout Spring Mrs. Samuel H. Overton, of Spout Spring and Mrs. John Hughes, of Oakville. His burial took place on Saturday even ing, at the family burying ground on the place, and was quite largely attended by friends of the family. Evergreen. We have had another fine rain. Crops are looking very well. The wheat is very good all through this part of the county. There is some complaint about the oats turning yellow in some places. The tobacco crop in general is rather small, but is growing well, and nearly every body has a good stand. The corn is looking green and is growing well. The crops of clover and grass are not of much account There are about 75 railroad men now at work here. - Alost of t.heni spend their nights in our village, anu it is something of a sight to see them come in at night. The mer chants report good sales now, espe cially of cider. They cant keep a supply of that equal to the demand. We are sorry to learn that little Gerard Davis is still very ill. Drs. Julian Abbitt and Walker are both attending him. Mr. Walter Davis has again been called to his bedside. Mrs. Sue Harvey continues very ill at her home near this place. Mrs. Ed. Hamilton has been call ed home in great haste to attend her husband, who is very ill of fever. Mrs. Nat. Gregory last week spent several days visiting her husband in and around this place. She won many friends by her pleasant man ners and sweet ways. We heartily hope that she had a pleasant visit, and that she will come again. Mr. N. H. Gregory left on Mon day for the Hill City. Mr. Geo. Carter, of High Bridge, was in our town on Monday.
