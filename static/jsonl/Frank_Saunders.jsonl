Mr. Glass sent a copy of atelegram to himself from Robert W. Woolley, chairmaq of the publicity committee of the National Democratic Commit tee, in which he calls attention to the fact that in some States electors are required to file their accounts within fifteen to thirty days after election, and suggesting that Mr. Glass look into the matter at once. The Attorney-General, who was leav ing the city just as the telegram came, wired Mr. Glass that, as a measure of precaution, he. advised that the elec tors do file an account. In any event, Mr. Pollard says, they will have until December 7. Though no statement was issued from the office of the Attor ney-General, it is understood, from un official sources, that Mr. Pollard will hold that electors are required to file expense accounts.
