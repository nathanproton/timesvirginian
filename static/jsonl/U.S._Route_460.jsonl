A report just completed by the Departments accident study, section showed that during the 22 months prior to the traffic engineering changes, nine accidents were re ported. One person was killed and three were injured. Since the changes which were completed in May, 1955, under the direction of District Engineer J. H. Phillips, of Lynchburg, only five accidents have been reported. J. P. Mills, Jr., traffic and plan ning engineer for the Department, said that although there was no de crease in the number of people in jured in the after study period, there were 38 pen cent fewer acci dents involving property damage. He noted also that during the per iod of the study, average daily traffic increased almost 18 per cent. Investigations made in 1954 by the Highway Department and the State Police showed the necessity of eliminating the Y-shaped inter section of the two heavily travel ed routes, Mills said. This was done by directing westbound traffic on Route 460 onto old Route 26, which intersects Route 460 from the north at a right angle. That por tion of Route 460 between Routes 24 and 26 is now one-way for easibound traffic. Improvements included installa tion of oversize guide and destina tion- signs and widening a short section of pavement on the old road.

I feel sure that with some clear weather we will be able to complete these two streets within the coming week. The Town Council has passed a resolution rjquesting the Traffic Section of the State Highway De partment to help us in the installa tion of three blinking caution lights on Route 460 one at the intersec tion of Court Street with 460, one at Church Street and 460, and the third at the intersection of 460 and 131 in front of the C.

Bids on the latter project, which would take the divided highway to 10.5 miles west of Bedford, were re ceived by the Highway Commission on October 19, but contracts have not been awarded. The work on US 460 east of Lynchburg and on US 58 between Danville and South Boston is par allel construction which will not ef fect traffic. The reconstruction of US 360 between Meherrin and Green Bay also will be held to new location and all road previously graded will be surfaced for winter travel, Resident Engineer J. L. Parker, of Dillwyn, said. The pro ject involves widening the road and heavy grading to cut down hills for longer sight distance. Construction on US 29 between Woods Mill and the Albemarle Coun ty line will be confined to reloca tions, roadside grading and drain age structures and there will be little interference with traffic. Resident Engineer E. L.

The building of a new county high school seemed a certainty by toe end of year as Appomat tox supervisors approved toe funding of toe new school throu gh toe issuing of 2 million in bonds to be sold to toe Va. Public School authority. Aonomattox business establi shments made progress during toe year. At least two faced a major rebuilding challenge. The new year of 1971 brought a night of destruction in a Janu ary tire which leveled the shop of Shearer Robertson, photo grapher and manufacturer of picture plates. Also destroyed was the shop and equipment of Dr. G. P. Gelsler, optometrist. Both locations were adjacent to each other on Church Street For Robertson toe fire meant loss of hundreds of negatives needed in his work and other reoords plus loss of valuable cameras and other equipment. He, his wife, daughter and son- in-law and other staff members met the challenge to rebuild a business with long hours of work and dedication. Dr. Gelsler moved to a Main Street location and was soon dispensing new glasses and eye-care services once more. The county had a new shop ping center, Triangle Plaza, opened in December with toe Su per Dollar variety store and Kings Market. Revco Drugs was getting ready for a flrst- of-New Year opening. Cloverhill Manufacturing Co producers of modular homes, moved from toe eastern sec tion of toe county on Route 460 near Evergreen, to toe west Rt. 460 location of 460 and 613 and a larger plant for as sembling homes The Appomattox County Chamber of Commerce pro vided information service for more than 766 potential visit ors, students and others. Mrs. W. E. Chenault, secretary an swered almost 800 inquiries. In addition, 25,000 brochures were shipped to toe Va. State Travel Council for distribution and 9,150 brochures to other ag encies. Appomattox, long known for excellence in sports, continued that tradition during 1971. Ap pomattox County High School Varsity basketball p l a y e r s played an 18-3 season. Raid er ettes were undefeated in re gular season play and were district trophy winners. The Jayvees won toe district bask etball trophy, and although all three teams failed to bring off tournament trophies, it was a good year overall. Webbs Tire Service, J. E. Jamerson and Sons, contractors and Lawson Ford were among toe many who remodeled andor enlarged their places of busi ness. The countys taxable property values jeached 20,625,749 an increase ot 313,638 over 1970. For tobacco farmers it could be termed, generally, a very good year. Leaf production was up slightly from toe pre vious year. Increased rainfall during toe growing season was good news for many. Flooded lowlands cut down hay produc tion for some f a r m e r s but warmer weather up through December kept pastures grow ing for a longer period. The past was remembered, too, as American Legion mem bers and other residents and friends turned out in large num bers on Sunday, May 30 for toe dedication of a War Memorial to fighting men lost in World War I, W.W. H, Korea and Viet nam. A flame glows nightly at toe memorial to honor fallen comrades.
