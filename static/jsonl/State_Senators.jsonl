One concerns the appointment of registration boards, who, daring this year and next year, will register vot ers under tLe provisions of the con stitution. The ordinance provides that there shall be appointed by the convention a board of registrars for each magisterial district in a county who shall register voters under a new registration prior to the 20 tb day of October, 1902, and again prior to the 20th day of October, 1903 They are required to sit at least One day at each precinct. They \u00e8re limited this year to 15 days re- histretion in a district and next year to 10 days. The number of days may be extended by the county court. This board will be author ized to register under the old soldier danse and the understanding clause which expire Jan. 1 , 1904. The roll they make up will be permanent. With them the elections will be held this and next fall. The poll tax prerequisite will not go into effect for the next two elections, that is until Jan. 1 , 1904. Another ordinance reported by the, revisioncommittee puts the new con stitution into effect. The present legislature is charged with the duty jrf putting it into operation and is isAiinited time in which to do it. Itts brciereu r-aneton the sec ond Wednesday in nexclTbreSltier. The ordinance extends the terms of most state and cbunty officers. The present judicial system is continued until Feb. 1, 1904, when the new dtcnit court will take the place of the present county and circuit courts and the clerk of the circuit court will assume the dual duties of clerk of county and circuit court. All district and county officers whose terms expire July 1, 1903, and who Would have to be elected the pre- - vious May are made to hold office until Jan. 1, 1904, and the election is fixed for November instead of May. The clems whose terms would bold until July 1, 1905, are cut back to Jau. 1, 1904, and the clerk to take their place is elected with other county aud district officers and mem bers of the legislature in November. The terms of all Capitol officers in Richmond, except those elected by the people, are ertended from Janua ry to March, 1904. State senators whose terms expire next fall will be elected for two years, and in 1905 all the senators will be elected for four years. The terms of governor and most state officers elected by the peo ple are extended! February follow ing the date of the election of their successors iu the preceding Novem ber. The registrars who are to be ap- pointed by the convention for Ap pomattox county will probably be named by our representative, Mr. Flood, and those for Buckingham- Cumberland by Mr. Hubard. We trust that these gentlemen will se lect good men to fill these responsi ble positions. These registrars are to make up the permanent lists of the voters of these counties, under the understanding and soldier claus es of the constitution. If we under stand the promise of the convention, no white man is to lose his vote. Give us good men, gentlemen  and let the good work under the new constitution start right. The Baptist Ministers Conference this morning adopted a resolution upholding the Rev. C. H. Crawford in his anti-saloon league work, and speaking of his unjust prosecution at the hands of Judge Campbell. The resolution is as follows Whreeas, the Rev. C. H. Craw ford criticised the action of the judge of Amherst county court for his course in a certain liquor case before him, and the said judge, for this critcism, cited Dr. Crawford for contempt of coart, and compell ed his attendance. Resolved, That while we do not pass upon the truth of the state ments made by Rev. Mr. Crawford, not being personally and indivuallj acquainted with the facts, we most heartily condemn the course pursued by the judge in thus denying the freedom of the press in the criticism of a course already closed.

The legislation calls for a minimum 5-cent refundable deposit on all beer and soft drink containers, effective July 1, 1977, allowing industry 18 months to adjust to the new lw Basically, the bill is an expansion of the existing deposit system on reusable containers.

When a retailer gets a container back, he returns the deposit, delivers the container to the distributor, and is reimbursed for the deposit and paid a sm all handling fee by th . distributor. The bill also provides for redemption centers, which may be established by retailers or local governments or as private enterprises, to receive contain ers and turn them over to distributors in return for payment of the deposit and handling fees.

It is well-known that Mr. Ellyson hesitated to accept the chairmanship of the State Committee because he ra op, osed to the silver plank of the Chicago platform and feared his position would do harm us its chair man. The announcement of his changed iews at this late and critical mo ment in his canvass is a matter open to conjecture. Is-it a vote catcher? If it is it is a leaky one. The man that is elastic enough to be pressed out of his natural attitude is elastic enough to reassume it when the pressure is removed. We prefer a man that stands nat urally and easily on the Chicago platform, silver plank and all a man like J. Hoge Tyler. Four year ago Mr. Tyler was honest enough to declare himself for free silver when it was unpopular md was honest enough to stick to it, and went down to defeat clinging to his honest convictions. Now would it not be wiser in Mr. Ellyson to do the same if he would aspire to be Governor in the future.

Senator MeCorkfe writes the fol lowing to the Rockbridge Count News Attention to many affairs bas .de toyed my making some observation, in regard to the May conference the reasons for calling it, its arrestee progress, the attitude of the sign ers aud their purposes in regard ti kindred reforms. While I admire your independent criticism of men and movements- for in a free press and an unstable judiciary, the liberty of the people and the life ot the republic find their surest hope and guarantee, yet l feel sure that your late edi torial criticism of the confereuc. will cause in the minds of man misappreheasion of the motives oi many of the signers. The call was signed by many men of many mindsall agreeing, however, in the necessity for such . movement and divided only as te thers. best plan ot action. They wished to project and prosecute it within party lines, without bring ing in any factor to imperil, by dis tension, party supremacy. They wished to agitate the important issue upon its own merits. The old method of electing U. 8 . Senators by the State Legislaturet was wisely left open, by the fram ers, though au auieuded clause, to any change that after i vents might require, its purpose was to secure equality of voting power umoug tin States. Modern conditions, however, oi political manipulation and self in terest have proved it as nugatory as another clause of the constitution guaranteeing each state against in vasion whose binding force was crushed by a bloody civil war direc ted by the Federal government. It is a common occurrence now for a State Legislature to sit all session and fail to elect a Senator. tBuTfeaViirjfliicBtates right to the appointing power fff the governoi The liberty gaiued in 177oBy people was in 1787 by politicians anxious to perpetuate sectional, frit tered away, checked and lodged so far from the people in boards, legis latures and governors that they the people lost the power, as they surely had the right, to easily re move uegligent officials. The Sen ate has refused so far to pass a reso lution asking for an amendment to elect directly. In legislative bodies so far away from the people as the Senate, and existing by long tenure, there is a tendency in class interests to strengthen themsel ves a g a in s t change. In creating the Senate to represent property and the Huose to represent the people the fathers unwittingly laid our republic in the very mortar of class distinction. Power gravitates towards power and this tendency has followed the Senate through all its changes. The furmers placed the purse the power to raise revenue by taxation in the House the sword the power to protect the people and states in the hands of the President, and the scales of justice the power of arbi tiation between citizens in the Su preuie Court, With capitalism tending to control the industrial wealth of the country and lodging in the Stnate, who holds the purse Who wields the sword? Who dis peuses justice ? Who is sovereign Instead of being a check, as the fathers hoped, on hasty legislation by the House, the Senate thus be comes a very check on the wishes and liberties of the people, holding an almighty vote power with no limit save its own will to its de mauds and privileges. In Englands House of Lords, the model and prototype of the U. Senate, capitalism baBed on beredi lary lauded estates, has fortified itself by statute and precedent an til it can obstruct at will the peo pies demands. The great bill of justice aud home rule for Ireland framed by Gladstone and approved by England, they defeated.  The tendency of sue h bodies to increase their privileges is evident Not long ago the clerk ot the.U. S.

New Orleans and San Francisco are contesting for the honor of hold ing this Exposition, and both cities have guaranteed Immense sums of money as an evidence of their ability to finance so great an enterprise. An Exposition worthy of the term Worlds Fair, such as New Orleans proposes to build, will be a great ed ucational movement. Its success as such, however, will depend entirely upon the percentage of our popula tion who can secure its educational advantages, this in turn, depends up on its location, as the time in travel ing , to and from the Exposition, and the cost in railroad and Pullman fares, are the most important factors. Considering these matters, New Orleans claims to being the Logi cal Point for this Panama Exposi tion, seem to be fully substantiated by the following facts New Orleans Is 500 miles from the center of population In the United Estates. San Francisco Is 2,500 miles distant therefrom. Within a radius of 500 miles from New Orleans there are 17,500,000 people. Within the same radios from San Francisco there are only 2,000,000. Within a radius of 1,000 miles from New Orleans, there are 65,000,000. Within the same radius from San Francisco there are only 6,000,000. At an average of 900 mileB from New Orleans, there are 70 of our principal cities with a combined population of 20,000,000. Averaging 900 miles from San Francisco there are only 8 large cities, with a com bined population of just 1,000,000. The average distance of all these cities to New Orleans is 792 miles, to San Francisco 2,407 miles. Over 75 per cent, of the people of the United States could go to an Exposition there at an average ex pense for railroad fare of 12.50, as against an average of 37.50 to the Pacific Coast and for several mil lions of our people, the Pullman fare and Dining Car expenses alone, for a trip to San Francisco, would amount to more than all their trans portation expenses for a trip to New Orleans. This Is an important public ques tion to be settled by Congress at the session which convenes in December. Many of our readers will wish to visit this Worlds Panama Exposi tion, and If held in New Orleans a great many more could spare the time and money for the -trip than could go to San Francisco.

The signing of the protocol is re ferred to, and then tbe Message relates the details of the negotations which ended In a suspension of hostilities, the appoint ment of the military commissions to superintend the evacuation of Cuba, Port\u00f2 Rico and the adjacent islands and the peace commission. Continuing, he says Peace Commissions Work. Pursuant to the fifth article of the proto col, I appointed William B. Day, lately Secretary of State Cushman K. Davis, William P. Frye and George Gray, Senators of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid to be the Peace Commissioners on the part of the United States. Proceeding in due season to Paris, they there met on the 1st of October five Commissioners similarly appointed on the part of Spain. Their negotiations hare made hopeful progress, so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definite treaty of peace before the Senate, with a review of the steps leading to its signature. Government of New Possessions. .1 do not discuss at this time the govern ment or the fatare of tbe new possessions which will come to us as a result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will be ap propriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the meantime, and until Con- tress has legislated otherwise, it will be m\u00ff Suty to continuetbe military Governments which have existed since onr occupation, and give to tbe people security in life and property and encouragement under a just and b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient rale. Independence Alone For Caba. As soon ns we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified tbe island, it will benec- essary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for them- selves. This should be undertaken at th\u00e8 earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success.  It is important that onr relations with this people shall be of the most friendly oharacter and our commer cial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every prop er way to build up the waste places of the Island, encourage the industry of the peo ple, and assist them to form a government which shall be free and Independent, thus realizing the best aspirations of the Caban people. Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent, and humane Government, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all international obligations, and wbich shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity, and promote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither revenge nor passion should have a place In the new Govern ment. Until there is a complete tran quillity in the island and a stable Govern ment inaugurated military occupation will be continued. Friendly Relations Witn All Nations. With the one exception of the rapture with Spain, the Intercourse of the United States with the great family of nations has been marked with cordiality, and tbe close of the eventful year finds most of the is-, sues that necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign States, adjusted or. presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable solution by amicable agreement. The President dwells at some length on the long unsettled- boundary dispute be tween the Argentine Republic and Chile, and expresses pleasure that his efforts to induce them to resort to arbitration have been successful. He also refers to the strong hope he has that the rates charged on the cables of American corporations in tho transmission - between Buenos Ayres and the cities of Uruguay, Brazil and the Atlantic cities of South America may be freed from an almost prohibitory discrimin ation. He favors an international agree ment for an interenange of messages over connecting cables. Then taking up home topics he says Austria and the Lattimer Strike. On the 10th day of September, 1897, a conflict tcok place at Lattimer, Penn., be tween a body of striking miners -and the Sheriff of Luzertie County and his depu ties, In which twenty-two miners were killed and forty-four wounded, of whom ten of the killed and twelve of the wound ed, were Austrian and Hungarian subjects. The deplorable event naturally aroused tbe solicitude of the Austro-Hungarian Government, which, on the assumption that the killing and wounding involved tbe unjustifiable misuse of authority, claimed reparation for the sufferers. Apart from tbe searching investigation and peremptory action- of the authorities of Pennsylvania, the Federal Executive took appropriate steps to learn the merits of the case, in order to be In a position to meet the urgent complaint of a friendly power. The Sheriff and bis deputies, hav ing been indicted for murder, were tried and acquitted after protracted proceedings and the hearing of hundreds of witnesses, on the ground that the killing was in the line of their official duty to upnold law and preserve publie order in the State. A rep resentative of the Department of Justice attended the trial and reported its coarse fully- With all the facts in its possessioni this Government expects to reaah a har monious understanding on the subject with that of Austria-Hungary, notwithstanding the renewed claim of- the latter after learn ing the r\u00e8sult of the trial,for indemnity for Us,injured subjects. After an extended reference to the y e  s events in Central America, he devotes the following pagraph to the Nicagus Canal Nicaragua Canal a Necessity The Nicaragua Canal Commission, under the Chairmanship of Bear-Admiral John C. Walker, appointed July 24, 1897, under the authority W a provision in the Sundry Civil aot of Jane 4 of that year, has nely com pleted its labors, and the results ot its ex haustive inquiry tntotheproper route, the feasibility and- the cost of construction of an lnteroeeanio oanal by a Nicaraguan route will be laid before you. In the per formance ot its task the commission re ceived all the possible courtesy and assist ance from the Governments oLJJicaragua and Costa Bica, which thus testified their appreciation of the importance of giving a speedy and practical outcome to the great projeot that bas fqr so many years en grossed the attention of the respective countries. As the scope of the recent inquiry em braced the whole subject, with the aim of making plans and surveys tor a canal by tbe most convenient route, it necessarily included a review of the results ot previous surveys and plans, and in partioul those adopted by the Maritime Canal Company under its existing concessions from Nica ragua and Costa Blea, so that to this extent those grants necessarily hold as. essential a part in the deliberations and conclusions of the Oanal Commission as they have held and must of need hold In the discussion ot the matter by the Congress. Under these elrenmstances, and in view of Overtures made to tbe Governments ot Nicaragua and Costa Rlep by other parties for a now canal concession, predicated on the as sumed approaching lapse of the contracts of the Maritime Canal Company with those States, I have not hesitated to express my conviction that considerations of expedi ency and international policy as between the several Governments Interested in the construction and control of an interoceanic canal by this route require tbe maintenance of the status quo until the Canal C ommls sion shall have reported and the United States Congress shall have had the oppor tunity to pass financially upon tbe whole matter daring the present session without prejudice by reason of any change in the .existing condifious. Nevertheless, it appears that tbe Gov ernment of Nicaragua, as one ot its last sovereign sets before merging Its powers In those Of the newly formed Cqlted States ot Central America, has granted an optional concession to another association, to be come effective on the expiration of the present grant. It, does not appear what .surveys have been made or what route is proposed under tjtts contingent grant so that an examination of the feasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced in the report of the Canal-Commission.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co.

Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight.

He has been a member of the General As sembly since he was 22 years old. He is chairman of the committee on Fish and Game of the Senate, second on Privileges and Elections, fourth on Courts of Justice, and is a mem berof the Committee on Printing. He is a close attendant upon the ses sions of his committees and a good worker. He was the leader in the Senate of those who favored our present election laws, without radi cal changes, and made one of the ablest speeches on this, subject that has been made in the Senate. In his defence of our election laws he was supported by many of the stron gest senators. He isbold and aggressive in what ever he advocates, and rarely fails in his undertakings. He represents a section in which party feeling is higher than in any other sectiou of the State, and the last contest in his district was very bitter but the re suit was a splendid triumph for Mr. Flood. He carried the district by I, 000. which was lost by the Demo crats in 1894. He has a large and extensive law practice, which he never neglects for anything except to perform his political duties. He is considered particularly strong as a jury lawyer. As Attorney for the Commonwealth for his county he has been particularly successful, rarely ever failing to secure a convic tion when he asks for it. Mr. Flood is spoken of as a for - midable candidate for Congress in the coming fight. If he is nomi nated, it is certain that the eastern part of the district, which is the doubtful end, will give the Demo cratic ticket a splendid majority.

Lumber had to be in that treaty. Canda was more wrought up about the imposition of that special duty on lumberadded when the copper, oil and coal Interests were getting their specific protectionsthan about any thing else. Her point appealed par ticularly to Secretary of State Cordell Hull because she could easily demon strate that she had been buying two dollars worth of American goods for every one dollar of Canadian goods bought In the United States. And Mr. Hull doesnt like tariffs anyhow. But once lumber was put in the Canadian treaty, the Pacific Northwest hit the ceiling, and stayed there for some timefait the ceiling so hard that trusty scouts reported to Post master General James A. Farley that If the election were held today both Washington and Oregon would go Re publicanor rather, would go anti- Roosevelt. There were plenty of conferences here on that news. No one not familiar with the electoral vote tables, which Insiders have been jiggling here for i the last few months, would realize how big that news washow bad to i the New Dealershow grand to Re publicans. For with New England concededly l out the windowas confirmed by every  pollit is imperative for President i Roosevelt to make a pretty clean sweep  in the West Washington has eight  electoral votes, Oregon five, but those  thirteen become mighty important if  the whole Northeast is leaning Re publican. Woodrow Wilson carried Washington, but lost Oregon, but he carried Ohio, and that big bloc of elec toral votes is far from safe for Roose velt, from all present reports.  Promises Made As a result of all this worry there was some conferring with officials of I the lumber associations. All sorts of promises were made. Canada was to stagger her shipments to the United States, so that Canadian lumber would not be dumped up to the full quota allowance during any one period. Lum- I ber was to be give more consideration In various other treaties which are on the fire. Big efforts will be made by the State department to open up new markets for American lumber. Some of the lumber men have been pretty well taken into camp as a re sult They promise to smooth down their senators and representatives on Capitol Hill. They even promise kind words for the administration. But some of the promises made are not so easy of fulfillment The trouble lies In that most favored nation clause, which is dear to Secretary Hulls heart To illustrate, this coun try might induce some country anx ious to buy a lot of lumber to re duce its tariff, and thus open up a new market for the American lum ber interests. But the moment that nation did that she would also be reducing the tariff to precisely the same degree to every other nation. Which would mean that Canada would have the same oppor tunity, on an equal basis, and probably without any quota restriction.

The vote on the ratification of the German treaty, which came first, was 66 to 20. A few minutes later the Austrian treaty was approved by tbe same vote. Ratification of the Hungarian treaty followed quickly by a vote of 66 to 17. The difference in the vote was due to the departure from the chamber of three opposition Senators Before the Hungarian treaty was acted upon. The action concludes the three-year struggle to make peace with the Cen tral Powers of Europe. Peace with Germany and Austra will become an accomplished fact immediately upon the formal exchange of ratifications. Hungary has not yet ratified the treaty. The margin in favor of ratification exceeded themost optimistic estimate of Administration leaders. Fourteen Democrats, led by Senator Underwood, of Alabama and Senator Hitchcock, of Nebraska joined the Republicans in support of the treaties while only two Republicans were recorded against ratification.

The Senate attached two conditions to its ratification in the form of reser vations previously recommended by the Foreign. Relations Committee. One of the reservations reserves to Con gress the power to control American participation in the Reparations Com mission under the Versailles treaty. Before the Administration can appoint an American representative to that commission, it will have to secure a legislative act from Congress specific ally authorizing the appointment, and then it will have to submit the ap pointment to the Senate for confirma tion. The other reservation is designed to prevent Germany from escaping pay ment of claims which may he pressed against her as a result of damage to life and property paused by the sink ing of the Lusitania.

Administration leaders urged adop tion of the resolution on the grounds that the United States was morally obligated to extend a credit of 5,000,- 000 to Liberia as a result of Liberias participation on the side pf the Allies in the World War. Opponents con tended no moral obligation existed and charged Republicans with en deavoring to put through the loan in order to-carry political favor with the negroes in the United States.
