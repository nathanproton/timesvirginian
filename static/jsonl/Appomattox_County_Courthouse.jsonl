He complains about the debts we fowe for school buildings. The bool hoards of the County do owe ePLlterary Fund for money bor rowed to aid in building the Appo- mattox high school, the Stonewall high school, and the graded schools at Oakville, Tower Hill, Vera, and Pamplin, but they are paying what they owe as it falls due, and the in terest on what they owe, out of the school levy, and will continue to do so. We also owe the Literary Fund for part of the money necessary to build the dormitory at Appomattox but we borrowed tiffs money on 15 years time at 3 interest, and the small rental charged teachers t and scholars for rooms in this dormitory will pay the interest and retire the debt as jt matures. This is un doubtedly a good business proposi tion, but no sound business proposi tion ever penetrated the head of D. Mott Robertson. The Appomattox high school, in eluding grounds, building, and equipment, has cost not less than 30,000, over twice as much as the court-house and jail cost. The County of Appomattox has only subscribed 2,000 of this amount. The rest of it was given by the State subscribed by patriotic citizens, anc borrowed from the State. The original amount we borrowed to build this school was 7,500. The interest on this and 4,500 of the principal has been paid out of the school levy. Future interest and the other 3,000 will be paid in the same way. A safe business proposition oi! this kind in the interest of the children of Appomattox County does not appeal to D. Mott Robertson because he is opposed to the children of any part of the County havin the same advantages the children of other counties have at least, his letter justifies the conclusion that such is his opposition. We are for the schools, for good schools all over the County, and with the present rate of taxation, before many years roll around we will have good schools within the reach of every child in the County, . Dr. Robertson alludes with much bombast to the time when he was Treasurer, as if he ran the whole business. We know that the Boar of Supervisors to which he refers Messrs. Ligon, Thornhill, and Jones were .capable and honest officials and progressive men, and un doubtedly would have done more for the development of the County if Dr. Robertson had promptly paid over the taxes he collected.
