Youve turned one trick too many on the sinks, young fellow, if the man that put your mark on yJu aint in this room, youU never get him. Which means, I take it, youre going to try to get me, smiled De Spain. No, bellowed Morgan, it means we have got you., You are fooling yourself, Harvey. be Spain addressed the warning to Lo gan. And you, too, Sandusky, he added. Well take care of that, grinned Logan. Sandusky kept silence. You are Jumping into another mans fight, protested De Spain steadily. Sassoons fight is our fight, inter rupted Morgan.   I advise you, said De Spain once more, looking with the words at San dusky and his crony,to keep out of I t Sandusky, yelled Logan to his partner, he advises me and you to keep out of this fight, he shrilly laughed. Sure, assented Sandusky, but with no variation in tone and his eyes on De Spain. Logan, with an oath, leaned over the bar toward Sassoon, and pointed con temptuously toward the end of the bar. Shike! he cried, step through the rail and take that mans gun. De Spain, looking from one to the other of the four faces confronting him, laughed for the first time. vBut he was looking without seeing what he seemed to look at. In reality, he saw only a cut-glass button. He was face to face with taking a mans life or surrendering his own, and he knew the life must be taken In such a way as Instantly to disable Its possessor. These men had chosen their time and place. There was nothing for it but to meet them. Sassoon was stepping toward him, though very doubtfully. De Spain laughed again, dryly this time. Go slow, Sassoon, he said. That gun Is loaded. If you want terms, hand over your gun to Sassoon, cried Logan. Not till Its empty, returned De Spain. Do yon want to try taking It? he demanded of Logan, his cheeks burning a little darker. Logan never answered the question. It was not meant to be answered. For De Spain asked it only to cover the spring he made at that Instant into Sanduskys middle. Catlike though It was, the feint did not take the big fel low unprepared. He had heard once, when or where he could not tell, but he had never forgotten the hint, that De Spain, a boxer, was as quick with his feet as with his hands. The out law whirled. Both men shot from the hip the reports cracked together. Gne bullet, grazing the fancy button, smashed through the gaudy waistcoat  the other, as De Spains free hand struck at the muzzle of the big mans gun, tore into De Spains foot. San dusky, convulsed by the frightful shock, staggered against De Spains arm, the latter dancing tight against him. Logafi, alive to the trick but caught behind his partner, fired over Sanduskys right shoulder at De Spains head, flattened sidewise against the gasping outlaws breast. Hugging his shield, De Spain threw his second shot over Sanduskys left shoulder Into Logans face. Logan, sinking to the floor, never moved again. Supporting with extraordinary strength the un wieldy bulk of the dying butcher, De Spain managed to steady him as a buf fer against organs flre until he could send a slug over Sanduskys head at the instant the latter collapsed. Mor gan fell against the bar. Sanduskys weight dragged De Spain down. For an instant the four men sprawled in a heap. Sassoon, who had not yet got an effective shot across at his agile enemy, dropping his revolver, dodged under the rail to close. De Spain, struggling to free himself from the dying man, saw, through a mist, the greenish eyes and the thirsty knife. He fired from the floor. The bullet shook without stopping his enemy, and De Spain, partly caught under San duskys body, thought, as Sassoon came on, the game was up. With an effort bora of desperation, he dragged him self from under the twitching giant, freed his revolver, rolled away, and, with his sight swimming, swung the gun at Sassoons stomach. He meant to kill him. The bullet whirled the white-faced man to one side, and he dropped, but pulled himself, full of fight, to his knees and, knife in hand, panted forward. De Spain, rolling has tily from him, staggered to his feet, and, running in as Sassoon tried to strike, beat him senseless with the butt of his gun. His own eyes were streaming blood, His head was reeling and he was breathless, but he remembered those p t the gang waiting outside. He still could see dimly the window at the end of the bar. Dashing his fingers through the red stream on his fore head, be ran for the window, smashed through the sash Into the patio and fonnd Sassoons horse trembling at the fusillade.

If the Voters take a part in the final election of the Democratic primary nominees, you are taking a part in helping to select the state officers that will run your state gov ernment for thg next 4 years.

Paris Is competing with London and New York In the making of the smart est and most appealing styles In out door clothes. When any type of dress Is exploited from all sides It always means that if the models are pretty OPd becoming a certain number of women will wear them with little sense of fitness. That Is, a so-called pastime hat may be woru with a gown to which It Is entirely unsuited. This is also true of shoes. We have cut adrift from the old standards which governed the selec tion of footwear. The final blow was dealt with the wholesale adoption of patent leather for low-heeled walking shoes. With the flooding of the mar ket with many excellent ideas In dress at one time there always comes a mis application of the best of them. Both sweaters and dresses are made In two or more contrasting colors that Is, of silk or  ool in a plain color patterned In high relief. Among the prettiest of the sweaters are those in lavender brocaded in blue. A new model in these-shgdes which closes down the front like the very old-fashioned coat sweater is long, coming almost to the knees, and has long sleeves which flare at the bot tom. There is a high collar button ing up about the neck.. The sweater itself is lavender and around the bot tom and on the sleeves and the collar are squares knitted In blue. It Is bloused by means of an elastic band placed low on the Inside. White Flannel and Serge. A great demand for any particular type of dress Is a wonderful inspira tion to designers and manufacturers and an incentive to do their best in that particular line. While there is the greatest diversity of color In the outing costume, here as everywhere else, a few colors become the extreme of fashion. In the plain shades brown, gray and white are favorite, while in the brighter hues there ore unusual shades of cerise, purple, yel low and red. Emphasis is placed on yellow and black used in unison. A complete reaction from black in daytime clothes is manifesting itself in the other extreme, white, for street wear, particularly white witli color. And on this wave comes white flannel as well as white serge of an extremely, soft and fine texture woven In part of camels hair, which, mixed wifh the wool, gives a marvelous effect. The kasha serge of Itodier is of this char acter Jeanne Lanvin has been responsible largely for this movement to white serge and flannel with trimmings of embroidery In high colors, a trimming which she always has favored and in which she ever hrs excelled. One of her best models Is in white serge em broidered in a brilliant Chinese red with little flakes of black as a relief. Another interesting model of white serge Is of simple design with slim panels on the bodice and on the skirt. Tills frock is embroidered In red and 6lack in a Jugo-SIav patter. A greut many of Lanvins embroideries are In Russian and Jugo-SIav designs.. There are charming frocks of white serge done with bead embroideries in high colors after Russian motifs.

Items such as these are about to crowd the money out of the gov ernments huge vault in the treas ury building basement, Tiie stuff was turned over to the treasury as unclaimed by the state department. For safe keeping. Most of it originally belonged to Americans who were living in for eign countries. W h e n nobody showed up to claim it, it was given to the American diplomatic rep resentatives. They shipped it to the state department. The treasury would like to do something about it, but cant. There is no law which would al low it to hold a public auction on the huge stacks of German marks from before World War I or Rus sian rubles. Secretary Helpless Secretary of the Treasury Sny der is as helpless as the next one. For one thing, he doesnt even know the combination to the safes. W. K. J ulian, the treasurer of the United States, knows how the locks work, but hes not talking. Anyhow, to get back to buttons and hairpins In 1934 the state department sent a small boy over to the treasury under heavy guard with a large envelope, along with a little note stating that the owner could not be located. Ihe treasury people opened the folder and found one pair of horn rimmed spectacles with g o l d mountings in a black case one cuff button one collar button one womans handbag containing a pair of manicure scissors, one gold earring, a gold ring and a Cuban coin worth about a nickel a rusty .22 caliber revolver that wouldnt shoot and a cheap watch, junior size, that wouldnt run. The three hairpins turned up in j another packet, which came from Yokohoma, Japan Articles Pile Jp As the years go on, such tilings pile up and gather dust in the dark, massive vaults. The collection goes back a long way. One letter on file tells of a flock of bonds captured in Louisi ana in 1865 and turned over to the treasury for safe keeping, They are still there. The letter says the bonds, payable to the city of New Orleans, were worth at the time 4,476,980 and were captured at J Shreveport July 12, 1865, by Gen. Philip Sherman. There are a lot of curios in the vaults. One is a gold medal which was supposed to have gone to a man who did a lot of heroic work in fighting an epidemic of yellow fevei in the tropics. The name of the man isnt on the record, but the medal inscribed to An Un sung Hero was turned over to the vault keepers. The buttons and medals and bonds keep coming in. The treas ury is about to throw in the sponge or move to a larger building."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["button"], "snippet": "one 10 karat collar <mark>button</mark> and three hairpins.
