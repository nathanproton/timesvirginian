F. P. Crawley, chairman, today. The chairman, a volunteer her. self, said, When I talk about vol unteers, I am referring to doctors, nurses, teachers, bankers, druggists, Store - keepers, housewives, high school girls and boys, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts.. almost anyone you can think of .. because they all have a stake in the great fight. She added that the Appomattox unit is aiming to raise 900 this year. This means person to person contact. It is only through talking with a person that the complex prob lem of cancer can be presented with the utmost force. And when we talk with people during April, which is Cancer Con trol Month by act of Congress, we are not merely asking for money as important as that is. We are tell ing them of our educational pro gram, of how they can watch for the danger signals, or how they can save their own lives, perhaps, and those of their loved ones by alertness and prompt action, I am happy to report that in the course of our campaign in years gone by, our doctors reported more people coming to them for check ups, more people showing up with early cancers that were in the cur able stage, than at any other time of the year, she said. With our enlarged and enthusiastic group of volunteer workers, we should make a better record than ever this year. The money raised in Appomattox will be used for the year - around program of education, service and research. This means preparation of educational material for distribu tion through every possible media, the provision of dressings and oth er sickroom comforts to cancer patients being treated at home, the contribution to tnc re search program which will ultimate ly find the answer to cancer.
