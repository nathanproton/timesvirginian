Evrod Conner, who is retiring after 17 years as a member of the APS cafeteria staff. Dora and I have shared many happy years together, said Mrs. Annie Laurie Babcock, long time friend and a retired co-worker. Doras association with the school system goes back to 1952 when she worked with Mrs. Babcock at the old Appomattox High School. She was a part of that cafeteria staff for eight years. In 1960 Conner began working with Poe Hardware Co. and remained there unto 1966. Doras love of children prompted her to return to work with the school system this time in the cafeteria at Appomattox Primary School. We first started our work together when we were at the old high school with 12 grades, said Babcock with a smile. We cooked on a coal burning stove with ashes, soot and smoke it was especially bad on Monday mornings. But, we never failed to have lunch on time. Dora Abbitt Conner, the daugh ter of the late Mr. and Mrs. George Francis Abbitt Sr. was born at Gravel Knoll, the Abbitt property formerly known as the Ola Webb Place. Along with the family of six, Dora attended New Hope Baptist Church, going to and from the services in a Model T. Ford. Still an active member of the same church, she is active in Sunday School, WMU, Outreach, and other church related activities. Being a good neighbor and doing for others comes naturally to Dora Conner .... shes always been a caring person. A younger brother commented on her cuing attitude. Doras always been a caring person, always caring about other people, commented Herbert Ab bitt, a local pharmacist. When we were little, I could always count on Dora to be my protector! Abbitt commented with a laugh. Dora C onnerattended  Vera Elementary School and Appomattox Agricultural High School later it became Appomattox High School.
