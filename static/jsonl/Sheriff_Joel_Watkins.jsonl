At least I am hoping he will prove a poor prophet. Ice formed on the morning of the 22od but I am t Id that frcst is more to be feared than ice. The writer witnesed the reoo t ball game between Hampdeu-Si uev and Bandolph-Macon, said to have been a fioe game, while he looked on with comparative indifference for the simple reason be didnt know the rales and failed to catch on to a catch, to recognize a foul, to know short atop from long stop and utter ly unappreciative of a perfect pitch Having been raised onchumneyand cat and bandy theres no wonder that the game is all new to him And what a crowd did witnes this game. Farmville out in full force and fall drees while the surrounding country emptied itself of fair maid ena and manly men. And that so many people should cheerfully pay fifty cents to go on an old field to watch boys at play is wonde-fu again. B-t play ball is the slogan of the hoar while from President Wilson to the small boy of tie streets there is genuine interest in the game. And President Wil-on enjoys advantage over most of ns as he approaches every gate armed with a freo ticket. Those who have shall have more abundantly. Mr. Joel Watkins begins to look like a permanent resideut of Farm ville. Fine fa mer will make a fine inspector and the loss of Appomat tox will be Farmvilles gain  King Adams, the ancient and honorable sheriff of Cumberland has been shaking hands with Farm ville friends and no one is more cor dially received for he makes sunshine wherever he goes. An old soldier was asked in the presence of friend King whether or not h6 would take in the reunion at Gettysburg and said he was too old when the sheriff said, Im too young. May he live long and Im snre he will never resign. The sheriff says that Cumberland is aroused on the sub ject of good roads and is ready to do ner nil part in the work or se curing them. Buckingham ditto, Farmville the same so there canbe no s oh word rs failure. And j m t here let me say that the sand-topped road way has come to stay. Only  few days since I drove over the two miles and three quarters of maca dam road leading out from Farm- ville and that cost about 111,000 and on leaving the macadam at once travelled over the sand-covered road way andbeyond controversy the last named was the better road of the two. Aud in this connection 1 am reminded that Mr. Ben Johns, who went with his motor car to Rich mond to give his father daily out ings, on his return from Richmond for most of the way moved over these sand roads and pronounced them absolutely satisfactory, free from mud, smooth, well drained and just fine. This being so it seems to me that the road problem has been solved for this section of Virginia The sand i - here and when properly applied and then properly drained the al year round good road has been secured. And instead of the macadam coBt, some 14,009 a mile, these roads may be had lor an aver age of 600 a mile. The circuit court for Prince Ed ward is in session as I write and the docket is of unusual interest. And the case now on is that of Miss Thackston vs. Drs. Anderson and Hudgins, the charge being that of malpractice and damages claimed 25,000. Messrs Hester and Jest- if I have the names correct of Lynchburg, represent the plaintiff and Mr. H. W. Anderson, of Rich mond, brother of Dr Anderson leading counsel for the defenee. As in all sneh cases the doctors differ widely and there ie evidence of bad blood. A large crowd attends upon the hearing of the case and intense interest manifested. The jury was eleoted in Cumberland and is made up of a fine body of citizens, mostly  farmers. They are good listeners and may be relied upon to render a just decision. A trained stenogra pher is on haDd and every word of testimony taken down, both sides no doubt preparing for an appeal if beaten in this Court.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.
