The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Independence Alone For Caba. As soon ns we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified tbe island, it will benec- essary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for them- selves. This should be undertaken at th\u00e8 earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success.  It is important that onr relations with this people shall be of the most friendly oharacter and our commer cial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every prop er way to build up the waste places of the Island, encourage the industry of the peo ple, and assist them to form a government which shall be free and Independent, thus realizing the best aspirations of the Caban people. Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent, and humane Government, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all international obligations, and wbich shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity, and promote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither revenge nor passion should have a place In the new Govern ment. Until there is a complete tran quillity in the island and a stable Govern ment inaugurated military occupation will be continued. Friendly Relations Witn All Nations. With the one exception of the rapture with Spain, the Intercourse of the United States with the great family of nations has been marked with cordiality, and tbe close of the eventful year finds most of the is-, sues that necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign States, adjusted or. presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable solution by amicable agreement. The President dwells at some length on the long unsettled- boundary dispute be tween the Argentine Republic and Chile, and expresses pleasure that his efforts to induce them to resort to arbitration have been successful. He also refers to the strong hope he has that the rates charged on the cables of American corporations in tho transmission - between Buenos Ayres and the cities of Uruguay, Brazil and the Atlantic cities of South America may be freed from an almost prohibitory discrimin ation. He favors an international agree ment for an interenange of messages over connecting cables. Then taking up home topics he says Austria and the Lattimer Strike. On the 10th day of September, 1897, a conflict tcok place at Lattimer, Penn., be tween a body of striking miners -and the Sheriff of Luzertie County and his depu ties, In which twenty-two miners were killed and forty-four wounded, of whom ten of the killed and twelve of the wound ed, were Austrian and Hungarian subjects. The deplorable event naturally aroused tbe solicitude of the Austro-Hungarian Government, which, on the assumption that the killing and wounding involved tbe unjustifiable misuse of authority, claimed reparation for the sufferers. Apart from tbe searching investigation and peremptory action- of the authorities of Pennsylvania, the Federal Executive took appropriate steps to learn the merits of the case, in order to be In a position to meet the urgent complaint of a friendly power. The Sheriff and bis deputies, hav ing been indicted for murder, were tried and acquitted after protracted proceedings and the hearing of hundreds of witnesses, on the ground that the killing was in the line of their official duty to upnold law and preserve publie order in the State. A rep resentative of the Department of Justice attended the trial and reported its coarse fully- With all the facts in its possessioni this Government expects to reaah a har monious understanding on the subject with that of Austria-Hungary, notwithstanding the renewed claim of- the latter after learn ing the r\u00e8sult of the trial,for indemnity for Us,injured subjects. After an extended reference to the y e  s events in Central America, he devotes the following pagraph to the Nicagus Canal Nicaragua Canal a Necessity The Nicaragua Canal Commission, under the Chairmanship of Bear-Admiral John C. Walker, appointed July 24, 1897, under the authority W a provision in the Sundry Civil aot of Jane 4 of that year, has nely com pleted its labors, and the results ot its ex haustive inquiry tntotheproper route, the feasibility and- the cost of construction of an lnteroeeanio oanal by a Nicaraguan route will be laid before you. In the per formance ot its task the commission re ceived all the possible courtesy and assist ance from the Governments oLJJicaragua and Costa Bica, which thus testified their appreciation of the importance of giving a speedy and practical outcome to the great projeot that bas fqr so many years en grossed the attention of the respective countries. As the scope of the recent inquiry em braced the whole subject, with the aim of making plans and surveys tor a canal by tbe most convenient route, it necessarily included a review of the results ot previous surveys and plans, and in partioul those adopted by the Maritime Canal Company under its existing concessions from Nica ragua and Costa Blea, so that to this extent those grants necessarily hold as. essential a part in the deliberations and conclusions of the Oanal Commission as they have held and must of need hold In the discussion ot the matter by the Congress. Under these elrenmstances, and in view of Overtures made to tbe Governments ot Nicaragua and Costa Rlep by other parties for a now canal concession, predicated on the as sumed approaching lapse of the contracts of the Maritime Canal Company with those States, I have not hesitated to express my conviction that considerations of expedi ency and international policy as between the several Governments Interested in the construction and control of an interoceanic canal by this route require tbe maintenance of the status quo until the Canal C ommls sion shall have reported and the United States Congress shall have had the oppor tunity to pass financially upon tbe whole matter daring the present session without prejudice by reason of any change in the .existing condifious. Nevertheless, it appears that tbe Gov ernment of Nicaragua, as one ot its last sovereign sets before merging Its powers In those Of the newly formed Cqlted States ot Central America, has granted an optional concession to another association, to be come effective on the expiration of the present grant. It, does not appear what .surveys have been made or what route is proposed under tjtts contingent grant so that an examination of the feasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced in the report of the Canal-Commission.
