AJao, under tbe Cannon rnles, tbe Speaker was chairman of the power ful committee on rules, and since he bad the appointment of his brother members on that committee, he ac tually controlled the shaping aDd direction of all legislation brought before the House. Under the pre sent rales, not only is the Speaker shorn of bis former autocratic power to appoint members of com mittees, and thns to control the ac tion of the committees, bnt he him self is not permitted to be a member of the committee on roles. Not content with the above-men tioned changes, the House progres sives adopted certain rnles which changed the committees from arbi trary bodies to advisory bodies, and which greatly enlarged the power and influence of the individual members of the Honse. For in stance, under the Cannon rnles, the chairman of a committee could practically prevt a vote being taken on a measure which had been referred to bis committee while un der the prednt rules, although a committee cnairman is influential and powerful when it comes to shaping legislation coming before his committi e, he cannot prevent thy Honse from voting as to whet her or not a measure shall pass the House. The standpat Republicans, toget her with a few reactionary Demo crata, most of whom have since been retired to the shades of private life, fought hard againss the revision of the Cannon rnle, bnt tbey were overwhelmingly defeated, the new rnles were adopted, and Cannon- ism took its place among the things that used to be. In the fighting that preceded tbe final victories of the progressives in the lower Honse of Congress, Mr. Flood was always on the firing line, and he, together with Bepresenta tives A. Mitchell Palmer of Penn sylvania, Clande Kitchin of North Carolina, and James Hay of Vir ginia, ably assisted Bepresentative Oscar W. Underwood of Alabama in the bringing about of those pro gressive reforms that practically re stored to the people the power to shape legislation in the halls of Congress. Previously, when tbe Bepnbli- cans were in control of the Honse, Mr. Flood had frequently attacked the reactionaries who had entrench ed themselves behind the Gannon rnles, and on one occasion when the infamy of those rnles was under discussion on the floor of the Honse, particularly with reference to their application to a bill for the relief of the tobacco growers of Virginia, the member from the Tenth Dist rict, himself the author of a mea sure having for its purpose the re- ief of the Virginia growers, rose in his seat, and by the grace of Mr. Speaker Cannon, delivered a most forctble address in which he scored the antocratic power exercised by the Cannon regime, which, be re marked, had taken from the mem bers of the HonBe the powers dele gated to them by the Federal Con stitntion. Space does not permit me to give yon more than a taste of the milit ant progressivism with which that particular speech was charged, so 1 must content myself with quoting one small paragraph, reserving for my next weeks letter a fuller ac count of the speech, whioh itself alone stamps Henry D. Flood as one of that band of active progres sives whose efforts jrill be a step nearer fnll fruition when Woodrow Wil.on takes his sent in the White Honse. Mr. Flood said When Oliver Cromwell cleared ont liie Parliinent Honse with a file of soldier, it whb no whit more tyranmoal, no whit moie subversive sf the fundamental principles of representative government, than this aeeumptiou of a power which should only be exercised by a ma jority of -this Honse,namely tbe power to legislate. The above words are a matter of record. Tbey stamp the man who uttered them as the kind of fight ing progressive who counts.

My lust two letters dealt princi pally with the earnest, nnremitting work in Congress done by the Hon. Henry D. Flood, and I wound up my last letter by promising to give yon a brief outline of the many progressive measures which tbe Member from the Tenth Virginia District has actively advocated, ami which prove beyond shadow of doubt tbat for a long time past he has been entitled to the name of Flood the Progressive. In the first place, I am reminded that Mr. Flood was a strong and active advocate of the Campaign Publicity Bill, which was demanded by all progressive Democrats and by a few progressive Republicans. Under the provisions of tbat Bill, the public would have been inform ed, both before and after election, as to the contributors to any campaign expense fund, the amount of money contributed and how it was spent. The standpatter countered against this Bill by passing a law which went only half way, and which in reality had the effect of locking the door after the horse was stolen. However, the progressives, of which Mr. Flood was and is one, finally attained their end. Then takr the three tariff-revi sion bills passed at the extra session of Congress which met in 1911, the Wood Bill, the Farmers Free- List Bill and the Cotton Bill. Mr. Flood actively and aggressively sup ported those measures, and voted for them at their passage. It will be remembered that the siandpatteis fought hard against those three bills, and that President Taft sided with them. Next came the four tariff-revision bills passed at the regular session of Congress this year,the Wool Bill the Metal Bill, the Chemical Bill and the Sugar Bill. Mr. Flood has aotively and consistently supported these measures, while the standpat ters in the House went to defeat fighting against them, and stood firmly against their passage by the Senate. In the latter body the pro gressive Republicans aided the De mocrats in saving two of the bills,in modified form, joined with the standpatters in killing another, and assisted the Democrats in passing a sugar bill, whioh while entirely dif ferent from the bill passed by the more progressive Honse, was far more in accord with the demands of the people than either the Dingley or the Payne tariff laws. And it should not be forgotten that while in 1911 the reactionaries were routed in both Houfe and Senate by i combination of progressive Demo oratsand Republicans, they were saved by the Presidential veto. W hat finally will happen, this year cannot be fore-told, but thus far the reactionaries have been beaten all along the line, and in every battle, Henry D. Flood has been in the front rank of the Progressives. In the very important matter of the admission of Arizona and New Mexico to the sisterhood of States, the right of the people to frame their own constitutions was vigor ously opposed by the reactionaries, and Progresssive Democrats were forced to accept that position be cause of their inability to mnster a two-thirds vote to over-ride the Presidential veto. The wrong Las been righted, however in America by the people themselves, who latei by an amendment to their State Constitution brought about the adoption of the identical idea that the Progressives in the Honse of Representatives had fought for, and that President Taft had vetoed. Mr. Flood was the author of tbr bill admitting Arizona and New Mexico to statehood, and workei unremittingly to accomplish the re suit to which the Democratic part was pledged, and to whioh the Re publican party had also been pledg ed for years, but whioh they had failed to bring about.

Former State Senator Floyd W. King, of Clifton Forge, who had previously carried Clifton Forge and Buena Vista, carried Fluvanna over Tucker by a vote of 141 to 111. The dele gates from Bath, which will have four votes in the conven tion, were instructed for Com mon wealths Attorney H H Byrd, of Warm Springs. The delegation from Bath is con sldered anti-Tucker. Botetourt county elected 32 delegates, each with one half vote. Eighteen of them representing nine votes, were instructed for Tucker. Of the remaining 14. three are conceded to Tucker, with the Lexington candidate claiming one or two additional NelBon with 12 votes and Craig with five were reported solii for Tucker with all delegates instructed. Probably the most inteieB t ing fight was w g-d in Nelson county, the rival candidates there being Mr. Tucker and Col. Aubrey E. Strode, of Am herst, both of whom were present at Massies Mill. The Massies Mill district elected four Tucker delegates, the vote being 135 for Tucker and 13 for Strode. Lovingston district elected five Tucker delegatee, the vote being 127 to 109 Satur day. Schuyler district, by a vote of 40 to 25, elected two Tucker delegates.  1 am relieved that the fight is over, of course I am gratified with the results in Nelson Botetourt and Craig, said Mr. Tucker. Stuart Moore, Tucker manag er at Lexington, issued a state ment declaring that  returns from the counties selecting delegates to the democratic convention to be held in Staun ton, February 14th, make it a foregone conclusion that Harry St. George Tucker will be the choice of .that body as the partys candidate for Congress to succeed the late H. D. Flood. Anti-Tucker politicians con tented themselves with point ing out that the three delegates from Highland, five from Cum berland and two of those from Botetourt, who are claimed for Tucker, are not instructed, and so far as they know, have not announced whom they will support As the matter now stands, Tucker claims six more than enough votes to nominate on the first ballot and is confident that no futures developments can bring about his defeat. Alleghany county delegates are instructed for Major Rich ard F. Beirne, of Covington, and those from Appomattox are not instructed. Amherst county elected ten delegates Monday and instruct ed them for Col. Aubrey Strode  and Mr. Tucker as a second choice. Buckingham elects eight delegates to-day and it is expected that the delegation will be divided between Mr. Tucker and Col.

Flood, refuting the charge repeatedly made by Colonel Henry W. An derson, and spread through the State bv Republican campaign orators, that there were 45,000 persons in Virginia connected with or in the employ of demo cratic state and local authori ties, today gave out the follow ing statement  The Republican candidate for governor m his speeches makes the statement that there are over 45,000 persons con nected with or employed by the state and local govern ments of this Commonwealth. This statement before had been deliberately embodied in the Kepublican platform adopt ed at Norfolk and is being re peated by all or the orators the Republican party is send ing through Virginia to slander and traduce the state and its people. I have made careful inquiry to ascertain what baBis, if any, there is for these figures, and have been unable to secure any facts or figures that could by any stretch of the imagina tion justify this exaggerated statement. The following is a list of officers connected with the state and local governments of this commonwealth Examiners of Records 32. Judges 57, Officers and employ ees provided for in State Budget and various state institutions 3,400. 123 Local Boards of Re view, three months each 369. 23 Cities, average of twenty officers each, 460 100 Counties, average of tn officers each, 1 ,- 000. 450 Magisterial Districts, average of seven officers, 3,150. County and City treasurers 123. Clerks of Courts 127. Commit sioners of the Revenue 230 School Trustees 1,659. School Superintendents 109. Exam iners of Clerks of Courts 125 Total 10,841. I believe this number is a correct one, it is certainly ap proximately correct. I have uot included the 6,500 Notories Public because they are ap pointed for the convenience of the people and not only cost the state nothing, but actually pay the state five dollars each for their commissions. The total number of officers employed by the state and local governments are less than one-fourth the number claimed by Colonel Anderson. The Republican claim is but a sample of the inaccuracy of charges so freely set forth by the Republican candidate for governor and his followers Other statements and criti cisms of the administration of the affairs of Virginia by the successive Democratic ad mini strations are even more inac curate and misleading than that answered above."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["D", "Flood", "Henry"], "snippet": "WrvuK State Chairman H. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Flood</mark>, refuting the charge repeatedly made by Colonel <mark>Henry</mark> W.

D. Flood created a sensation by reading a letter from Judge George J. Hundley, of Farmville, addressed to the chairman of the Democratic S t a t e Central Committee, charging that Colonel Henry W. Anderson, in an address de livered at Farmville on August 30tb, had expressed himself as ashamed of the star in the United States flag which repre sented the State of Virginia. This astounding disclours fell as a thunder bolt upon the voters of the Fifth District who were present at the speaking. The letter, signed by Judge Hundley, the oldest circuit judge in Virginia, was written under date of September 9th. It was in reply to a communi cation from J. N. Brenaman, secretary of the Democratic State Committee. It reads in full, as follows Office of Geo. J. Hundley, Judge of the Fifth Judicial Cir cuit of Virginia. Farmville, Va , Sept. 9,1921. Hon. J. N. Brenaman, Sect. Democratic Committee, Richmond Va. My dear Mr. Brenaman Yours of the 6 th instant re ceived, and I write you, as ac curately as I can, what occur- at the time of Colonel Ander sons speech at Farmville. I note that you say the incident may be used by the committee. I have no objection to your using it,provided it is not based alone upon my statement, for it has been made public. It was published in the Farm ville Herald, and quoted and commented on by the Lynch burg News. I intended that it should be come buplic property, and that there should be no issue of veracity between him and my self, so I repeated to him what he had said, in the presence of the audience, and asked him if 1 had understood him correctly, and he admitted it. He saidWhen he was in the Balkans, trying to help and uplift those miserable people, he carried on the front of his automobile,the American Flag, and the women and chil dren would ccme up and kiss the flag, but that he was really ashamed to let them do this, for he felt that he was practic ing a fraud upon them, to al low them to kiss a flag having upon it a star representing the State of Virginia whose gov ernment was so unrepublican, so despotic, and so disgraceful as that of the State of Virginia. I waited quietly, until he closed, but before the audience dispersed, called upon him to explain thii.t statement, repeat ing what 1 had understood him to say. He did not deny it, but admitted it, with an awkward attempt to explain and which did not explain at all. I did not discuss anything with him but contented myself with Bay ing, Col. Anderson, there are men here who followed the flag of Virginia for four years in the Givil War, and those who fought for that Flag of ours in France, and shed their blood for it, and I want to say for them, that in all our history, there never has been a time, and there never will be a time, whilst the sun shines, that such a thing, as you have said, could be true of the Star repre senting our glorious old State on the Flag of our Common Country. W ith kind regards and best wishes, I am, Yours sincerely, Geo. J. Hundley. Judge Hundley, who presides over the fifth judicial circuit, is a veteran Virginia jurist and a veteran of the Givil War. He has a son, Lieutenant Robert G. Hundley, who saw service on the fighting front in France. Judge Hundley enlisted first with the Albemarle Howitiers, after which he served with the Fifth Vsrginia Infantry. He resigned from this regiment to enter the cavalry, in which arm of the service he remained until the close of the war be tween the states. He was seriously wounded while lead ing a cavalry charge. Lieutenant Robert G. Hund ley, also a war veteran, spilled bis blood in France in defense of the Stars and Stripes. His record was a brilliant one. He served with Company B., 306th Infantry, 77th Army Division with Company F., 120th Infan try, 30th Division, and with Company B., of the 369th New York. This latter regiment was brigaged with troops in the 161st French Army Divis ion, Fourth French Army. Lieutenant Hundley, who is now stumping for the Demo cratic ticket, was deeperately wounden in the campaign offensive on September 30th., 1918. Four major operations were performed on him and for some time his life was diapaired of. He saw eleven months active service in the Western front in France."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["D", "Flood"], "snippet": "afternoon Con gressman H. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Flood</mark> created a sensation by"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["D", "Flood"], "snippet": "afternoon Con gressman H. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Flood</mark> created a sensation by"}], "text_match": 1733921019837546617, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2216192835584", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1733921019837546617", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

A Richmond correspondent of the Washington Post reviews at length the political situation in the tenth congressional district of Virginia, and speaks as follows of the situation in this the Tenth district There will be a livelier racket for the Democratic nomination in the Tenth tnan in any other district in Virginia. It is now represented by Mr. Henry St George Tucker, who is serving his third term. He will be opposed for the nomination by State Senator H. D. Flood, of Appo mattox county, and who is a nephew of Senator Faulkner, of West Vir ginia. Mr. Flood is also distantly related to the Tuckers, bnt kinship does not prevent him from doing all he can to get the nomination. Another strong competitor for the nomination will be State Senator Pink Jones, of Highland county, He is ranked as the ablest man now in the Btate senate, and will make strong fight against Tucker. It also said that State Senator Echols, of Staunton, Mr. Tuckers home town, will be a candidate, and if he comes out there surely will be trou ble for the member from the Tenth. Senator Flood was a warm supporter of Thomas S. Martin, of Albemarle, for United States Senator. In fact, he was one of his managers, while Tucker sympathized with General Lee, and the Martin following, being powerful one in the state, they will naturally do all they can to help Flood to capture the nomination, As there is any chance of Tucker getting the nomination General Fitz- hugh Lee, who lives in the district, will not permit his name to be used in connection with the congressional nomination, bnt if it becomes known that Tucker is about to be knocked out it is more than likely that Gen eral Lee may be brought forward as a compromise man. At any rate, it looks as if there would be a red-hot fight in the Tenth. It is believed that Ex-Congressman Yost will be the Republican nominee in the dis trict this year.

While, the syndicate that has under taken the extension of the South and Western Railroad from the Virginia coal fields to a point on the South Atlantic oast is busy with the construction work in the North Carolina mountains, and also has several forces of men at work in Southwest Virginia, there is another project on foot to carry Virginia coal to the coast by a direct route. Henry K. McHarg, who owns the Vinginia and Southwestern Railroad, has deter mined to build a road from Clinchport to the Toms Creek Mines,, in Wise coun ty, Va., on practically the same route se lected by the South and Western peo ple. Mr. McHarg is having his proposed route surveyed and is said to be accu mulating material for construction work. There is a rumor that Mr. McHarg and Thomas F. Ryan, whose cash is back ing the other project, have been in inference with a view to joining capi tal and constructing only one road in stead of two. Dr. I. E.

A recent compilation of the records of Fairfax county gives some interest ing data relative to the wealth of George Washington. Washington inherited Mt. Vernon fromhisbrotherLawrence in I 75 2 but did not commence to reside thera until 1759, at the age of 27 years. At that time he owned in Virginia and other States 50,795 acres of land, besides sev eral thousand acres in Fairfax county. The magnitude of his farming opera tions in 1787 can be imagined from the fact that he had 580 acres in grass, 400 acres in oats, 700 acres in wheat and 700 acres in barley, buckwheat and other .cereals. He owned 140 horses, 112 cows, 226 oxen, 500 sheep and a large number of hogs. He employed 250 negro hands. In 1780 the records show that he slaugh tered 150 hogs for the use of his family and servants. B. J.

Yerily God is good, and we should be so thankful. The Buckingham High school opens here this Monday morn ing with a corps of teachers that I hope may prove the right people in the right place. A party of young people went out to Fountain Ridge the hospitable home of the Misses ilover, oae night last week and were delightfully enter tained there. Miss Eleanor Davidson spent last week visiting friends in this part of the county. Mr. Robert Eugene Hender- lite has been visiting around among his friends in this coun ty and he is a general favorite especially with the ladies. Hon. Henry Deleware Flood is a worthy and able successor Rorer A. James as State chair man of the Democratic party and to my way of thinking will make one of the ablest ex ecutives ol the party that haB served in Virginia since the days of the Hon. John S. Bar bour. I am told there was a reduc tion of 75 on Ford cars to take effect as of September 1st. Folks around here have been drinking fox grape wine and where it is well made it is very good indeed. Farmers are hesitating about fallowing land for wheat now that it is so late. The road and bridge have been completed near Curdsville and now we have a fine road, the length of the county from Wingina to the Prince Edward county line and on to Farm- ville. A request will be made to the Ford company to donate a Fordson Tractor to the agricul tural students here. Mr. D. N. Davidson has been employed as principal of the High School here for the coming session and it is probable that his wife will also be one of the teachers here. There is a vacancy in the teaching force at Dillwyn one of the ladies who was to have taught there having tele graphed on Saturday that she was not coming. The Buck ingham county and school fair will be held here November 3rd and 4tb, 1921. Protracted meeting began at Bethlehem church last Sunday. The Trustee Electoral Board met here recently and elected one trustee in each district for a term of three years as far as was practicable at the time the meeting was held. Mr. Rolf Wood was elected to fill the vacancy on the J ames River Board caused by Mr. H. M. Harris leaving the county. W. W. Haskins was elected to suc ceed himself as a trustee in Maysville school district. I ordered 1000 sheets of good writing paper at a price of 1.- 60 for the lot prepaid. There is general complaint of weevil in wheat and at the mills they are compelled to run the wheat through the cleaning machinery to get the little black bugs out, and unless cooler weather sets in soon much wheat will be rendered unfit for seed 1 50 seems to be the price for seed wheat as against 2.50 a bushel this time last year."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Henry", "Flood"], "snippet": "with the ladies.

Our special Washington cor respondent says of him The death of Flood is directly due to his fine devotion to his State and partv When tbs Republicans gave it out that they were going to break into the solid South and that Vir ginia was to be the gateway, everyone knew that it meant another loosening of the strings of the long purse that poured out millions and millions for the election of Harrison, Me Kinley, Roosevelt, Taft and Hardingthe long purse of privilege. The Virginia leaders looked over the field and could see no one but Flood to lea the fight to prevent the Repub licans again getting a foothold in the State that was still re- membring painfully the days of the carpet baggers So Flood wae drafted for the iob, though already Chairman of the Demo cratic Congressional Commit tee, he went into it like he went into every other fight with every ounce of force there was in him Of course he wod , aud the Democrats carried Vir ginia by the biggest majority ever known, but Flood came back to Washington and took to hi bed, never to leave it. Of him it can be truly said  He died with the harness on, the broad sword leaping, the wild fight surging fast  Rich as the party is in leadership, Democracy can ill spare him, this proud Virginian, proud of his clean hands, his clean pub tic record, Lis clean profession al career and his spotless personal character. It is re membered of bim that when he first came t j Congress, defeat ing Jacob Yost, a Republican, the result was very close ano he was offered the certificate of election on. a technicality, wbereu ton be refused to accept it, preferring to stand aside until the status of every ques cioned ba lot wae determined, be knew he might lose by so doing, but be preferred it that way. The folio wiug tribute paid our distinguished countyman by a life-long friend is worthy of both men Nobody seems to be able to realize chat Hal Flood, of Ap pomattox, is dead.
