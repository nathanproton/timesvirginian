The restoration fund of this APVA branch has been accumulating and is now sufficient to begin the work, Mr. Rawls said, but Isle of Wight, too, will set about raising money to complete the courthouse restoration by 1957.

If you had called upon that gen tleman at this early hour, you would have been disappointed, for his ser vant would have informed yon that Mars Hugh was still in bed. But, strange to say, if yon had examined the woods very closely you would have discovered him leaning against a large white oak. And the huge tree towering towards the sky was a suit able symbol of himself  for he was a magnificent specimen of man hoodtall, straight as an arrow, short hut heavy beard, powerful limbs, head proudly poised between a grand pair of shoulders, and with a general appearance that betokened him to he a man of about forty years of age. With it all his face was sto lid and unintellectual, filled with good humor and dogged pertinacity. He was evidently waiting for some one, and when the door of the cabin was opened, and a young girl came out, he moved around to the other side of the tree so that he might watch unobserved. The Hon. Hugh thought that he had never seen a fairer sight. He likened the form approaching him to a fair-haired god dess of the woods coming to take pos session of her realms, the forest. Nor was his comparison inappropri ate. She was a flaxen-haired, dark eyed little maiden, who came grace fully tripping over the dewy stubble, and who, a long time before, had cap tured the heart of the dignified gen tleman behind the tree. She did not care if he had been twice a widower, she had proudly and gladly accepted his attentions and had promised to become his wife.

At Pamplins we spent several hours most delightfully with thej family of Rev. W. E. Warren and Dr. and Mr. C. S. Morton, friends of other days. The drive from Pamplins over beyond Putneys was very pleasant, but we missed the mail boxes along the way. Crops  of all kir.ds are good, especially to bacco and fruit abundant.

This good old county is I the very plant bed of Presbyteri an, and of all the host of people we met, we shook hands with only four Baptsts and one Methodist.

At Felden, near Hampden Sidney we enjoyed meeting with Sargeant Rchard Allen, who served all through the Mexican and Civil wars It was indeed a treat to listen to his reminiscences. He is in his 83d year and is still very fond of hunt ing. We heard much in praise of Dr. McAllister, the new president of Hampden Sidney, and it is thought the number of students at the col lege will largely exceed that of last year. At Prospect we met with an old Appomattox friend, Mrs. Wm. Lew is. How our tongues did fly as we talked of the past, present and fu ture, and all too soon we heard the train that was to take us home. There are other things we would like to write about, but to tell of all the pleasure that was crowded into those ten days would make this letter too long.

But that is not only not a Christian way of living, it is not practicable. You n e e d t h e community a n d the community n e e d s you. If you want to tell the world good- bye, go rent your self a room on the 17th floor of some apartment house in N ew Yor k. You wont be bothered with callers! But if you live in the typical American town or country community, you not only cannot help knowing every body more or less, but you want to know them, you need to know them. -   The Community Includes Everybody QOME communities cease to be communties and become ex- elusive clubs no strangers can brejj in. A lady in a very old county in a long-settled state, said of her next-door neighbor That family came here sixty years ago they don t really belong here. Now a true community ought to include every one in it, and It isnt a real community until it dees. Jesus parable of the sheep and the goats suggests this. The trouble with the goats was that they just never saw the down- and-out members of the community at all. Your own neighborhood has in it, perhaps, some lonely people, unfortunate people, some human left-overs. What is the community doing for them?   The Church and Its Own Q N E practical thing that Chris- tians can do for their commu nities is to see to it that no Chris tian suffers want. However much we may disagree with the Mormons, there iS one feature of the Mormon f1  J hlch tbe rest of us might take to heart in all the depression ox a years ago, there never was a Mormon on relief. Probably in most small com munities the separate congre- gations are not large enough to do this kind of thing effectively Sn7 ly k a community where there are as many as three or four different denom inations, they might all plan n 80 .a whenever any Christian got into a strait, the fff k  Christians would stand by to help him. crJ!ier? wiU alwas be a need for general organizations such as the Red Cross or the Grange and the Community Chest but if Christians always stood by Christians, the rest of the community would at least have less to worry about.    It Takes All Kinds TH E ideal community is one in which everybody is a Christian and indeed all belong to the s a  church. But such communities are few and far between.
