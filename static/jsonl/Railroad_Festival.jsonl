Winnie-the- Pooh was secured by the Appomattox Junior Womans Club in co-operation with Sears Roebuck and Co. of Lynchburg. Winnie-the-Pooh is allowed only one annual visit to the Sears Lynchburg Store which was in July of this year. While in Lynchburg, he visited the childrens ward in the two local hospitals, Lynchburg training School and hospital, various nurseries, and the children s department in the Lynchburg Sears Store. For this reason, we should be proud to have Winnie-the-Pooh back so soon to this area to join in our Historic Railroad Festival. He will make his first appearance in our parade at 10 a.m. Saturday thereafter, during the festival he will be on Main Street to entertain the young people.

The festival is tentatively scheduled for the first week end in October. Council denied a request tendered by David Nash which would allow a development of Nashs sewage access, and in a separate but related action, heard a request from James A. Nolen concerning the relocating of the towns east sewage lagoon. Action on a motion by councilman Ronald C. Spiggle, council voted to contact the chairman of the State Water Control Board in an effort to raise the Appomattox priority for federal and state funding for construction of a new sewage treatment plant. Council also approved a -change of parking limits on N. Church Street, between High land Avenue and Confederate Blvd. The limit was raised from one hour to three hours. Mayor Henry Pack informed council that the town would pay a fosil fuel surcharge to Virginia Electric Power Com pany. The surcharge will mean almost 100 per cent increase in the towns electric bill. Council also voted to give 1,120 feet of Dogwood Avenue and 302 feet of West Street to the State Highway Department so that the streets may be paved.
