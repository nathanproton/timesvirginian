The deceased was a descend-1 ant of prominent pioneer families   of Campbell and Appomattox Counties and inherited their sterling qualities, gentleness of spirit and disposition, and talents of a home-maker. Being a child of the Reconstruction period, and the eldest daughter of a widowed mother, she learned economic independence early in life that gave her a broad under-  standing, general sympathy, and a prophetic vision of changing conditions. She joined New Hope Baptist Church in early girlhood and after her marriage to Mr. Burke, May 27, 1874, she became a con sistent member of Liberty Bap tist Church. Her love and  . thoughtful care were the inspir ation of her husband, her relig ious ideas and progressive ideas sent into the world eight leaders in church and secular activities, and her lavish hospitality en deared her and her family to a host of friends. Her influence for good was recognized through out the county, and having been next one to the longest residents of Appomattox she was beloved by distinguished and humble, rich and poor, young and old, white and colored. She knew i the joys and trials of youth, and all who had temporary homes with her spoke of her as their ! second mother, who exercised unselfishness, patience, and abil ity to draw out the best in those who came in touch with her. No word of adverse criticism passed her lips. She lived on a lofty, intellectual plane that ele vated those under her watch- care.  Truly a mother in Israel has , gone to her reward. Hers was no bland piety, but her life was ! a living epistle of her Saviors j teachings, and her children rise up and call her blessed. She embodied the finer traditions of  the past, and was conversant I with all developments of the present, and her full mind was I a beacon unto loved ones and I acquaintances. Hundreds of callers, numerous I telegrams from different states, many floral tributes attested for her wide popularity and general esteem. She is survived by the follow- j ing children Mrs. Walter C.

All of these men and women were from the farm and were of the ordinary type of farmers, neith er rich nor poor but a thoroughly rep resentative group. It is probable, judging from our Inquiries, that in any group of a similar number would have been found representatives of a similar number of co-operative enter prises. In Ireland we found, that coopera tion, under the leadership of Sir Hor ace Plunkett ably seconded by Rev. Thomas A. Finlay, George W. Rus sell, and R. A. Anderson, has revolu tionised rural Ireland. In fact co-oper- , ation and the opportunities whloh have come from the new land tenure laws have well nigh remoulded the Irish race itself. It la evident that in many sections his economic welfare has been so well served that the Irish man is even losing his pugnacity. He is no longer incessantly agin the government but is becoming a well contented citizen more intent upon his economic situation than upon his po litical surroundings. He is losing his interest in politics and we talked to many who seemed loath even to dis cuss so important a question as the home rule bill which was then pending and over which the politicians were becoming excited. The land tenure law has made it possible for him to secure a home co-operatton has made It possible for him to secure a home co-operation has made it possible for him to feed and clothe his family. No one can make such a trip of in vestigation as we have made without becoming convinced that into Ameri can rural life must come some form of co-operative enterprise. If it costs as much to take the farm produce from the farm to the city consumer as It does to produce it and this is an ad mitted fact it necessarily follows that our distributive system Is wonderfully 1 wasteful.

Immediately in frontof the chancel was an arch of flowers, from the centre of which was suspended a floral design in the shape of a horseshoe with the inscription! Good tu c k .

Gilliam, came down the right, and met under the arch, where they were declared man and wife in a solemn and impressive man ner by the Rev. Mr. Royall, of the Baptist Church. The arrangement of the bridal party abont the altar, the mellow lights and profuse decorations creat ed a scene of beauty rarely witnessed. The Bride was becomingly attired in a white surah silk, en train, a tulle veil caught up by a diamond brooch. A bouquet of Mar\u00e9chal Neil roses, tied with white satin ribbon, was carried in her hand. The bridesmaids were air attired in white silk, wifh natural flowers, the gfoomsmen in conventional black.

There was also present the bridal party of Mr. Robert G. Robertson, another son who had been married that morning in Amherst county. After a season of merry-making among the yonng folks, and on the part of the older ones, indulging in reminiscences of similar scenes in which they were the central figures, the assembled party was invited into supper.

Suffice it to say that it was an old-time Virginia spread,! which the guests did ample justice.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Through this door Spen cer Stevens escaped. That the public can reach a pris oner at any point in any cell of the jail is not denied by any one, not even Mr. Ligon. This fact alone renders the jail unfit for occupancy by dangerous prisonersno protec tion to the life of the prisoner or his safekeeping, for his friends could easily supply him with tools to lib erate himself, while, on the other hand, his enemies could stab or shoot him to death. Realizing this great dauger to prisoners, it has frequently occurred that the sheriff hae been ordered to remove the prisoner to some city or maintain an expensive guard for the protection of the pris oners life from the public. The county pays these bills. As to the escapes, we do not now recall that there has ever been an escape from the steel cages, but there came very near being a v holesa e deliveiy on one occasion, when Plun- ket, a prisoner outside of the cells, punched a hole in the brick wall and then went to work on the lock which opens all the cells, and but for the timely discoveiv of the keeper of the jail all would have escaped. A t this time the cells were crowded with negro prisoners, and Plunkett was a white boy outside of the cells. Now, Mr. Ligon, seriously, witn au axe anib-tf\u00ede privilege of the cor ridflff, I firmly believe that a fifteen year-old boy could open every steel cage and make good his escape in less than au hours time. It is our honest belief that you could not get a competent witness to uphold you before the court in defense that you have a safe jail for the confinement of criminals. Be lieviug this, we esteem it a privilege and duty to call your attention to this matter, that you may make the necessary improvements and avoid the expense of guards, relieve the public of fears, and protect the prisoners lives. That the jail is a fire trap has been proved by one fire, which re suited in the total destruction of the wood-work and a loss of 700 or 800 to the county. The sanitary condition of the jail is very bad, and already one death has occurred theie from fever. The improved and expensive modern and up-to-date sauitary arrangement has long ago been condemned by the health officer of the county. We believe the Board will realize the necessity of doing something in fact, it has been consideting the matter for a year or more, w hen we reflect that a prisoner is afforded no protection from the public that with the two cells filled and oue prisoner iu the corridor, all may es cape easily that tin re are only fom cells in alltwo for female- and two for males that lunatics and other prisoners are compelled to be as signed to the same quarters, thus increasing the unsauitary surround ing 8  that the locks are bad that the arrangement for headng is de fective and dangerous and that the whole premises are unhealthy, uti satisfactory and expeustv. In view of all of this, we main tain that our comity jail is a farce."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Plunkett", "a"], "snippet": "with negro prisoners, and <mark>Plunkett</mark> was <mark>a</mark> white boy outside of"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Plunkett", "a"], "snippet": "with negro prisoners, and <mark>Plunkett</mark> was <mark>a</mark> white boy outside of"}], "text_match": 1733921019703328889, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2216192770048", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1733921019703328889", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

One more nowthat of Spencer 1 Stevensand ou complete the long, fearful list of escapes with which i our jail is charged. Aud how did Stevens escape? He ulso held the whole jail as hisnot withiu the steel work at all, but withiu the brick walland no man cau safely say, until Steveus himself tells the story, whether the outer door was accidentally left unfastened by the jailer or whether Stevens himself unfastened it. He came out through the door. Now, if there is a bad lock any where, aud you say there is, the jailer has authority to replace such defective lock at any time, and will doubtless do so. But, grant that use and time has brought to us u defective lock, does that make the whole jail a joke and a farce ? Your suggestion of what the jail may need may be taken up later on. Our present purpose is to haye a cor rect view of the jail as it is to-day. Respectfully, W. H. L i g o n . Hixburg, Va. Our genial chairman of the Board of Supervisors comes at us with a denial this week of the charges we make concerning the jail. That the main steel door leading to the corridor around the steel cages can be opened with an ordi nary pocket-knife there can be no doubt, for we have the word of sev eral parties who have tried it suc cessfully. Through this door Spen cer Stevens escaped. That the public can reach a pris oner at any poiut in any cell of the jail is not denied by any one, not even Mr. Ligon. This fact alone renders the jail unfit for occupancy by dangerous prisonersno protec tion to the life of the prisoner or his safekeeping, for bis friends could easily supply him with tools to lib erate himself, while, on the other hand, his enemies could stab or shoot him to death. Realizing this great danger to prisoners, it has frequently occurred th.it the sheriff has been ordered to remove the prisoner to some city or maintain au expensive guard for the protection of the pris oners life from the public. The county pays these bills. As to the escapes, we do uot now recall that there has ever been au escape from the steel cages, but there came very near being a v. holesa e delireiy on one occasion, when Ilun- ket, a prisoner outside of the cells, punched a hole in the brick wall and then went to work on the lock which opens all the cells, and but for the timely discovery of i lie keeper of the jail all would have escaped. At this time the cells were crowded with negro prisoners, and Plunkett was a white boy outside of the cells. Now, Mr. Ligon, seriously, witn an axe aniLtfie privilege of the cor ridflf, I firmly believe that a fifteen year-old boy could open every steel cage and make good his escape in less than au hours time. It is onr honest belief that you could not get a competent witness to uphold yon before the court in a defense that you have a safe jail for the confinement of criminals. Be lieviug this, we esteem it a privilege and duty to call your attention to this matter, that you may make the necessary improvements and avoid the expense of guards, relieve the public of fears, and protect the prisoners lives. T hat the jail is a fire trap has been proved by one fire, which re suited in the total destruction of the wood-work aud a loss of 700 or 800 to the couuty. The sanitary coudition of the jai is very bad, and already one death has occurred theie from fever.
