What a deplorable fact that I cannot calculate percentage and count the time that it takes a letter or other mail matter to be taken from this point Saturday p. m-, placed in the little dead Vera post- office about 6 p. m., apd there re main until Monday p. m., at which time it w ill come out of its long rest ing place and journey towards West Appomattox. Well, suppose we send our letter Moudy. Is it not plain that our letters cannot possibly reach West Appomattox until late on Tuesdav ? I think if Jack w ill look over nis wonderful criticism he w ill see that he admiu that the Ulunfall mail gets to West Appomattox the next day after it leaves, on evet y day except Saturdays, and that is why i said that our letters to our aper must leave here by Saturday at least. When the R. F. D. is man aged for the good and convenience of the people as a whole, it w ill be yond a doubt be a good thing but when onr mail matter is delayed 24 hours, both in going and coming, it is a matter of concern to those who have to submit to it for as it is such an enormous expense we vainly hoped it would be a great improve ment on the former system. As it was, we received a daily mail direct from Lynchburg, and wecould write to Lyuohbnrg in the a. in. and it would be received that p. m. Now it is impossible and a very great in convenience. As to the accusation of reporting the percentage on boxes sold by Judge Christian, Jack w ill have to get some one else, as I neither understand nor made that statement, but 1 do know that several boxes have been given to parties living be tween Vera and Oakville, which fact Jack failed to state, but which is a small matter when so aiuch was at stake. But this does not affect this writer, as she is no pensioner, and though made a target for Jack from behind The Oaks, she will speak again when necessary, but at the same time she w ill usk Jack hereafter to ascertain fact before lie makes a statement in print, and if j he will come out from his hiding I place and tell where be got his in-  formation she  ill be under,many bligatious.

The fact is no effort has been made to publish the statement since 1913 with this office. No complaint of spacing out the mat ter has been charged before The Board waited until December, 1913 before submitting their state ment for publicationa very busy time with the paper, and we were forced to have the composition done in a large printing office in Baltimore in order to get it in our paper at all. We paid 20.36 for setting the type alone, which left us a net revenue for our paper ser vice of 49.64 for 140 inches of space. The charge of leading and unnecessary spacing is not true. It is solid and in 8 point typesmal ler than our regular reading mat ter type and the people who put it up are experts and had no in structions from us as to how they should do their work. Nor would this office permit any adveitiser to dictate to us what type an article should be put in to the extent of inconvenience to the office.

The correspondent from Arvonia in last weeks issue of this paper has an article on a question it is well to consider now, that of whether in toxicating drinks shall be sold . un der license in this county and he calls on candidates for the Legisla ture to come out and declare them selves on this question, to say if they are in favor of the Mann law, or not. There is not a licensed bar room in Buckingham and while some little violation of the revenue laws in the traffic of unlicensed whiskey and brandy has gone on, and will go on, It must tie noticeable to those who come here to Court and on other public days how mnch more orderly and well behaved the crowds are since no bar-rooms are here. It does go agains t the grain with some to have to send off and buy their whiskey, or do without their accustomed drink, but even drinking men dislike to come in contact with drnnken men, especi ally when they have business on hand. It is a fact .vorthy of note that Judge W. H. Mann got a majority in this county when the primary was held in which he was a candi date for the nomination for Gover nor. It was somewhat of a surprise that Hon. Oamm Patteson should withdraw from the contest for the contest for the State Senate though it was known his health was very bad. Mr. W. D. Patteson is a candi date for the Senatorial nomination at the hands of the Democrats from the Albemarle district. Oar neighbor the  Southside Virginian is giwing some mighty good advice to some of the candi dates for county offices in this county. Democrats are going to vote for the nominees of the Demo cratic party, unless, indeed the party should be so unfortunate as to place in nomination men who are not worthy, and this I trust they will not do. There is a report in circulation here that several plant beds have been destroyed in the northern part of the county by some enemy of the men who owned the plant beds, the report at this writing lacks con Urination, so I will not give names and particulars this week. The prize winners in the contest of drawing maps of Buckingham will be announced in next week paper. The prize offered is 25.00. That was a fine letter Uncle Van had in last weeks paper. I told him one time, that he onght to write- for the magazine, bat he said his writing was like a man he said who was cleaning up a new ground and being asked why he was doing ir, he said only as a matter of pastime or diversion, and Uncle V. says this is the way he writes, jnst to pass the time off. He certainly has a quaint way of expressing himself, peculiar ly his own. I never knew as many ties to be hauled to Dillwyn at this time of year, and some days hundreds of dollars are paid oat there.

The proposed Little Falling River Watershed is located in southside Appomattox County ly ing, generally, between state routes 727 and 604. It encom passes more than 6,000 acres in this county and 24,000 acres in adjoining Campbell County. What Is a Watershed? Harrison defines a watershed as an area of land drained by a given stream of water. In the case of Appomattox county wat ersheds, the streams involved are oreeks which ultimately drain into either the Appomattox or the James River.
