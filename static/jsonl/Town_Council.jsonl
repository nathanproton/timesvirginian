From a re construction of the events, it appears that the popular young doctor was shot as he approached the door of the -house.

Nearly two hours passed between the shooting of Tucker and the flni arrest, of May- berry- Mayberry was Yelled by a shotgun blast near a garage hide out from which he had fired from 30 to 50 shots from a pistol and a shotgun at the surrounding officers. Mayberry was given medical treat ment here and sent to Rlctnond Saturday morning. His wounds are said not to be serious. The midnight sounding of sirens and the use oi flares to light up the scene attracted the attention of a sizeable gathering of spectators and details of the tragedy have been the topic of interest here since.
