The Senate resolution, offered - by Senator Echols, of Augusta, for the formal election of United States sena tors at noon on Tuesday, January 23, and a joint election on Wednesday, the 24th, was concurred in by the House. The Senate concurred In a House resolution to arrange a joint session for February 22, when the State of Texas will present a portrait of Gen. Sam Houston to Virginia. Democratic Floor Leader Martin Williams, of Giles county, is strenu ously opposing the proposed tax com mission bill in Its present form, averr ing that it is not fair to Giles and other southwestern counties of the State rich in mineral deposits and other natural resources. Another measure which will meet with oppo sition is the Stenbenson bill to abol-, lsh gambling. Delegate Banks, from Norfolk, says the bill will mean the death of horseracing and bookmaking at the Jamestown racstrack. The Senate and House held a joint session and unanimously elected W. D.

The House concurred in the Senate resolution to do away with the pres ent system of leasing convict labor, and calling upon the joint committees on roads to consider the Governors message relative to roads and work ing convicts thereon.

The bill for a change in the city charter of Richmond for the creation of an administrative board, previously passed by the House, was passed in the Senate under a suspension of the rules, and now goes to Governor Mann for his signature. Delegate Cox, of Richmond, intro duced a resolution providing that Gov ernor Woodrow Wilson, of New Jer sey, be invited to address  joint ses sion of the legislature and of the Rich mond City Council on Thursday night, February 1, at 8 oclock. The resolu tion was unanimously passed, and when sent to the Senate was concur red in. One of the most Important bills in troduced in the House was presented by Delegate Harwood, of Richmond, providing for the amendment to the section of the code governing the state tax on corporations for the sup port of free schools, pensions and liquidation of the public debt. The present law provides a maximum fee of 600, imposed upon a company with a capital of 1,000,000, while on a company capitalized at 999,000 the tax is 199.80. It was announced in both Houses that the joint committee on roads would have a public hearing on the questions of roads and workirfe con victs thereon, according to the recom mendations of Governor Mantl, on Monday, January ?9. One of the provisions of the charter amendment bill for the city of Rich mond, which has passed both Houses of the legislature and is now in thte hands of Governor Mann for his signature, reads that the city has the right to erect and maintain, in con nection with the city prison, if the I Council so determines, a suitable  workhouse and a bouse of correction, to compel and require all able-bodied i adult prisoners confined to perform anual labor in such workhouse and to  employ all youthful prisoners in the house of correction.

Officials declined to re- val details, but they gave the impres sion of having reason to believe a seri ous purpose waR behind the bandit raid on the Coleman ranch. Three raiders were killed and three captured, one re port said, adding that they attempted to burn a railroad bridge near Laredo, but failed. The new force sent to join General Funptons border patrol, Secretary Baker said, was to fill in gaps in the guard, such as that near Laredo. It will be composed of 10 companies of coast artillery and a battalion of engi neers. The artillerymen will be with drawn from fortifications between Portland, Maine, and Sandy Hook, and the engineers go from barracks in this city.1 The Secretary said there was no present intention of calling out addi tional National Guard regiments for border duty.

The sudden death ot Algernon Eth eridge has been in more than one sense a great shock to the oommunHy.

Why he should have become the target ot Fate is one. of the mysteries of llfa rils watch, which, aside from his books, was his most valuable pos session, was the gift of Judge Ostran der. That It should be associated In any way with the tragic circumstances ot his death is a source of the deepest regret to the unhappy donor. This excerpt she hardly looked at .but the following ehe studied care fully Judge Ostrander inm from the first expressed a strong desire that Borne associate judge should be called upon to preside over the trial of John Sco ville for the murder of Algernon Eth eridge. But Judge SaunderS sudden illness and Judge Doles departure tor Europe have put van end .to these hopes. Judge Ostrander will take his seat on the bench as usual next Mon day. Fortunately for the accused, his well-known judicial mind will prevent any unfair treatment of the defense. The pro8ecntion,.in the able hands of District Attorney Foss, made all its points this morning. Unless the de fense has some very strong plea in the background the verdict seems fore doomed. A dogged look has replaced the callous and indifferent sneer on the prisoners face, and sympathy, if sympathy there is, is. centered entire ly upon the wife, the able, agreeable and bitterly humiliated landlady of Claymore tavern. She it is who has attracted the most attention during this trial, little as she seems to court it.We omit further particulars which followed to save repetition but they were carefully conned by Deborah Scoville. Also the following The defense is In line with the statement already given out. The prisoner acknowledges taking the watch, but from motives quite opposed to those of thievery. Unfortunately he can produce no witnesses to sub stantiate his declaration that he had heard voices in the direction of the bridge while he was wandering the woods in search of his lost child. No evidence of any other presence there is promised or likely to be produced. It was thought that when his wife was called to Jthe stand she might have something to say helpful to his case. She had been the one to ultimately find and lead home the child, and, silent as she had been up to this time, it has been thought possible that she might swear to having heard these oices also. But her testimony was very disap pointing. She had seen nobody but the child, whom she had found playing with stones In the old ruin. Though by a close calculation of time she could not have been far from Dark Hollow at the instant of the crime, yet neither on direct or cross examina tion could anything more be elicited from her than what has been men tioned above. Nevertheless, We feel obliged to state that, irreproachable as her conduct was on the stand, the impression she made was, on the whole, whether intentionally or unin tentionally. unfavorable to her hus band. Some anxiety was felt during the morning session that an adjournment would have to be called, owing to some slight signs of indisposition on the part of the presiding judge. But he rallied very speedily, and the pro ceedings continued without Interrup tion. Ah! The exclamation escaped the lips of Deborah Scoville as she laid this clipping aside. 1 remember hls ap pearance well. He had the ghost of one of those attacks, the full force of which I was witness to this morn ing. I am sure of this now, though nobody thought of it then. I happened to glance his way as I left the stand, and he was certainly for one minute without consciousness of himself or his surroundings. But it passed so quickly it drew little attention not so the attack of today. What a mis fortune rests upon.this man. Will they let him continue on the bench when hie fijll condition is known? These were ber thoughts as she re called that day and compared it with the present. There were other slips, which she read. The fate of the prisoner was in the hands of the Jury. The possi bility suggested by the defense made no appeal to men who hail the unfor tunate prisoner under their eye at every stage of the proceedings.
