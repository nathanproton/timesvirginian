There is a girl, she informed them, and I think she is about our age. 1 suppose she will attempt to buy her w ay into our crowd. She will wear better dresses than any of the rest of us, and she will think that just because she has more money than w e have that it is her place to lord it over us. Now, w e must show her that the old fam ilies of this town are not going to suc cumb to mere wealth. We must be quite oblivious to her guady display. It is fortunate we understand the situ ation before she comes, for now she will be given no opportunity to hu miliate us. All of this made a deep impression upon the four other girls. Marion, be cause she w as the most imaginative of the crowd, had become in a sense its leader. She had a peculiar, quick w ay of assimilating the things she read, and that made her companions feel that Marion had attained to a very deep understanding of life. The first day Caroline Stuart walked down the main street of Elmwood, they felt their suspicion that she would attempt to  lord it over them to be confirmed. Her gown bore the marks of a city dressmaker, and she walked very straight and carried her head very high. That w as partly because she had been1 taught to do so at school, and in part because, feeling timid with so many strange eyes upon her, she sought refuge in dignity. Her impulse was to look with friendly interest at the five girls as she passed- them, but feeling shy, she looked straight ahead instead.  Well, of all the airs! gasped Marion. It is evident that she feels miles above us! sputtered K itty Benton. We will not trouble her, comment ed Doris Morton, with dignity.  Its just as I told you, insisted Marion.  Now the only thing to do to let her absolutely alone. They did. When she passed them upon the street they were deeply ab sorbed in one another. They studied the art of passing her house without nowing it was there. When she be- gan driving in her pretty pony-cart they regarded it as a personal affront, The strange part of it all is that they ere in truth kindly girls, and would have felt very badly indeed at the idea of hurting any ones feelings. Their attitude bad grown upon them to such an extent that with the coming of tbe big red automobile, the first to be seen in Elmwood, the ignoring of Caro line Stuart had become a duty. Perhaps few girls of her age have ever passed as unhappy a summer as Caroline Stuart passed that year. Of warm-hearted, sunny nature, she was girl to whom friends were a neces sity. She was so free from any idea of distinctions created by money that the secret of the thing never dawned upon her. She supposed, on the other hand, that the girls did not like her. It was a beautiful day in September, and her young, naturally buoyant heart made her wish to get outdoors and be doing something, even if she must do it by herself. W ill and her father had gone in the automobile to an adjoining town, and her mother was lyiug down with a headache. So she started out alone to drive up the winding river road which skirted the edge of the woods. The country round Elmwood was very beautiful, and Caroline threw herself into the spirit of the day, tell ing herself that some time, in some other place, she would find friends to enjoy the world with her, and that meanwhile she would try to enjoy it by herself. She was succeeding in getting more pleasure out of the drive than had been hers for a long time, when sud denly she heard laughing voices, and peering through the trees, saw the five girls into whose friendship she had at one time supposed she would be taken They were spreading a cloth upon the grass and opening some parcels. She watched them through dimmed eyes until they sat down and began to eat, The, when she could bear it no longer, she whipped up her pony and started briskly up tho road. The day had lost its charm. She did not see the woods and the river and the soft sky. She kne,w only that the world seemed a hard, lonesome place, and that her heart was yeafning for friends and companionship, for the kind of fun those girls were having. It was very near the same spot that upon lier return, a half-hour later, she saw Marion Foreman and one of the other girls helping K itty Benton down to the river. It was evident that some thing had befallen hoi-, for she was hopping on one foot, and moving as if it pained her. Caroline guessed at ouce that the girl had sprained her ankle, and that they were helping her to the big. flat rock close to the river. They did not notice her until she was near them, so near that she heard Marion call to the girl behind,  Of course this had to happen the very day we walked instead of drove! and then they glanced up and saw her, and looked with studied care out at the river. Caroline drove by, her heart heating very fast. Every instinct prompted lier to offer to drive K itty Bentou back to town. But would they accept the offer? Would they not think a tie was trying to intrude, and tell her in so many words that they did not care to have anything to do with her? Of course they wouid, and she would not go hack.

It is unfortunate in more senses than obe that there should be a-i I investigation at this time into an act of the administration by which the step-father of the Presidents j wife will be largely benefitted. And! everybody sincerely wishes that the! Senate Committee on Public Lands will find everything straight about the Florida land patent for 23,000 lucres, which was recently issued to Mr. Perriue, the husdand of Mrs. I Clevelands mother, and which the Committee is now investigating. Ex Congressman Brookshire of In diana, is counsel for the settlers on this land, who claim that the grant was forfeited many years ago.  The Civil Service Commission has made answer to Senator Allens res olution, adopted by the Senate last week, as to the alleged dismissal of two women from a branch of the Agricultural Department, at South Omaha, Neb., for displaying pictures j lot Mr. Bryan in the late campaign. The answer says the Commission investigated the complaint when first made and that Secretary Morton denied that the discharges were! made for the cause specified, or tha I he knew the politics of those dis- I charged. The most significant por tion of the answer, especially to I those in office who regard themselves as being protected by the Civil Service Commission, is the following The Commission is not i an appointing, or reinstating, or removing body. Representative McRae, of Ark., who was one of the democratic mem bers of the coingage committee wbo I voted for the favorable report, with amendments, of the Senate bill auth orizing the President to appoint del egates fur any international nione  tary conference, called by any na tion or by himself, took occasion to I briefly state the attitude of the democrats toward the bill. He said the democrats had no faith whatever in such a method of. bring ing about the free coinage of silver, I but that they had no desire to place any obstacle in the way of the repub licans trying to carry out the prom ise made by their national platform   on the contrary, that they were anx ious for the next administration to demonstrate to the country what could be done along that line. Notwithstanding Senator Kyles assertion that he did not get the republican votes which reelected him by making promises, the repub- licaus in Washington are now count- mg upon his voting with them to obtain control of the Senate organi zation and to fill Committee vacan cies that will exist March 4th This confidence of the republicans 13 not bied upon any vague expec tation or hope they do not say Sen ator Kyle may vote with us, bin that Senator Kyle will vote with us In voting with the republicans in this particular case, should his vote settle the question, Senator Kyle will betray the principles he has professed ever since he entered the! Senate. As most people know, the Senate finance committee, as at pres ent made up, is controlied by silver although seven of its thirteen mem- bers, including the chairman, are republicans. There will be two vacancies in this committee on March 4th. Senator Sherman will enter the Cabinet and Senator Voorhees will retire to private life. The re publican leaders consider it necessary as this is the committee that will handle the new tariff bill, that both of these vacancies shall be filled by men .who can be counted upon to support the new tariff bill and to oppose any silver legislation that niay be proposed and they are say ing that Senator Kyle, whose advo- cacy of silver and free trade is widely known, will vote with them. If he does what will be the natural infer ence ? Representative Walker, of Mass, couldnt upset the Reed rules, but he conld and did express himself very vigorously on the subject, sav in part Under the rules of this House, we get mighty few rights. When you goto see about  bill, you are referred to a sub committee, and then you may cool your heels there day after day before you can get so much ar one member nf the snb- committee to bear you. And when you do he tells you he knows all about it and intimates that you are boring him. Then when he reports and -vou trJ to appeal to the fuU committee, yon get no satisfaction.

She is in her 83d year, I and is quite feeble, and as we held! her trembling hand at parting we I thought it would not be long be -1 fore she would hear the Well done I of her Master, whom she has sol faithfully served and enter into her reward. At Felden, near Hampden Sidney we enjoyed meeting with Sargeant Rchard Allen, who served all through the Mexican and Civil wars It was indeed a treat to listen to his reminiscences. He is in his 83d year and is still very fond of hunt ing. We heard much in praise of Dr. McAllister, the new president of Hampden Sidney, and it is thought the number of students at the col lege will largely exceed that of last year. At Prospect we met with an old Appomattox friend, Mrs. Wm. Lew is. How our tongues did fly as we talked of the past, present and fu ture, and all too soon we heard the train that was to take us home. There are other things we would like to write about, but to tell of all the pleasure that was crowded into those ten days would make this letter too long. After all the most pleasant sound we heard while gone was the conductors Evergreen and we realized that in a short while we would be at home, for there is no place like home es pecially if home be in d ar old Ap pomattox."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Morton"], "snippet": "and Mr. C.

A real investigation of the sugar 8canaalone that would go to the bottom of things and not get fright ened off when on the track of infor mation that would incriminate Sen ators, would be a good and desirable thing to have, but another fizzle like he last would be worse than useless, because it .would do ore harm than good. The people re cognize a job of white-washing as quickly when it is done by Senators as by humbler wielders of the brush. Senator Jones, of Nevada, who was inferentially charged by Senator Aldrich with having given out the sugar schedule before the tariff bill was reported to the Senate, is Chairman of the Committee on Contingent Expenses, to which Till mans resolution for a sugar inves tigation by a committee of five Sen ators was referred, and he says the committee will report the resolu tion favorably. That makes it reasonably certain that the resolu tion will be adopted, because number of Senators who would like to vote against it will not dare to do so. It will all depend upon the formation of the investigating com mittee whether it will mean business or a farce. Senator Tillman will be Chairman of the Committee. If he be given four colleagues as fearless as himself, the guilty Sen itors if there be any such, will be brought to book, and the sugar trust, the bead of which got cleared on that other indictment will also be shown up but if he be given colleagues who are afraid of thei hadows, nothing will come of the investigation. The Republican Steering Com mittee in the Senate is slowly but surely undoing the work of the sub committee that prepared the amend ment to the Dingley tariff bill, and by the time the bill gets through the Senate, the rate of duties imposed therein will aveage almost or quite as high as the Dingley bill. The tax on cea and the increased tux on beer are doomed, and we are likely to have an internal revenue tax on bauk checks, mortgages, etc., in their places, unless the republicans get frightened out of the idek by pro tests. Mr. T. G. Peyton, a well-known Virginia gold democrat, thus sizes up the present situation  It seems to me now that those of us who contribute to the success of the re publican ticket have been the vie tims of a confidence game. As view it now, a very great mistake was made la3t November. It would have been much better for the conn try to have elected Mr. Bryan have not become a convert tv fre! silver since the election, my belief in sound money is as strong as ever but I am satisfied that if Bryan had been elected, the country would have recovered more quickly from the ills that have afflicted it. Senator Morgan was doubtless out of order when he made that stirring attack upon Speaker Reed and the House on the floor of the Senate, but the attack was certain deserved and Senator Morgans assertion that the present methods of the House are not constitutional is receiving close attention, and may result in a change. The selection of Whitelaw Reid vnd his brother-in-law, Ogden Mills, to be respectively Special Ambassa dor and Secretary to the A mbassador to represent the United States at the Queens Jubilee ceremonies in London, is another indication of Mr. McKinleys disposition to cater to the wealthy. Whitelaw Reid, hanks to his father-in-laws money md some never very clearly ex- amed business manipulations, squired a controlling interest in the paper established by Horace Greely and later by political trickery got Levi P. Morton turned down by the republican National Convention and himself substituted for Benja min Harrisons running mate in the last campaign. These may be easons why he should be especially honored, but why Mr. Mills who has never been anything but an idle society man should be honored is explainable on any other ground than that of money-worship on the part of Mr. McKinley."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Morton"], "snippet": "trickery got Levi P. <mark>Morton</mark> turned down by the"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Morton"], "snippet": "trickery got Levi P. <mark>Morton</mark> turned down by the"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The president and the president elect sat in the first row of seats di rectly in front and almost under the desk of the presiding officer. In the same row, but to their left, were the vice-president-elect and two former vice-presidents of the United States, Levi P. Morton of New York and Ad- lai A. Stevenson of Illinois. When the distinguished company en tered the chamber the senate was still under its old organization. The oath of office was immediately admin istered to Vice-President-elect  Mar shall, who thereupon became Vice- President Marshall. The prayer of the day was given by the chaplain of the senate, Rev. Ulysses, G. B. Pierce, pas tor of All Souls Unitarian church, of which President Taft has been a mem ber. After the prayer the vice-presi dent administered the oath of office to all the newly chcsen senators, and therewith the senate of the United States passed for the first time in years into the control of the Demo cratic party. Procession to East Portico. Immediately after the senate cere monies a procession was formed to march to the platform of the east por tico of the capitol, where Woodrow Wilson was to take the oath. The pro cession included the president and the president-elect, members of the Su preme court, both houses of congress, all of the foreign ambassadors, all of the heads of the executive depart ments, many governors of states and territories, Admiral Dewey of the navy and several high officers of the sea service, the chief of staff of the army and many distinguished persons from civil life. They were followed by the members of the press and by those persons who had succeeded in secur ing seats in the senate galleries to witness the days proceedings.  When President Taft and the presi dent-elect emerged from the capitol on to the portico they saw in front of them, reaching far back into the park to the east, an immense con course of citizens. In the narrow line between the onlookers and the plat form on which Mr. Wilson was to take the oath, were drawn up the cadets of the two greatest government schools, West Point and Adnapolis, and flanking them were bodies of reg ulars and of national guardsmen. The whole scene waa charged with color and with life. On reaching the platform the presi dent and president-elect took the seats reserved for them, seats which were flanked by many rows of benches rising tier on tier for the accommoda tion of the friends and families of the officers of the government and of the press. Mr. Wilson Takes the Oath. The instant that Mr. Taft and Mr. Wilson came within sight of the crowd there was a great outburst of ap plause, and the military bands struck quickly into The Star Spangled Ban ner. Only a few bars of the music were played and then soldiers and ci vilians became silent to witness re spectfully the oath taking and to listen to the address which followed. The chief justice of the Supreme court delivered the oath to the presi dent-elect, who, uttering the words, i will, became president of the United States. As soon as this cere mony was completed Woodrow Wilson delivered his inaugural address, his fitst speech to his fellow countrymen In the capacity of their chief execu tive.
