The honor of being the party key noter is such that friends of Mr. Abbitt are delighted that he was accorded such a distinction. In re cent years he has moved up rapidly in the inner councils of the Demo cratic Party, both in Virginia and in Washington. This latest honor is evidence that he is now recognized as the sound leader of a dominant segment of Virginia citizens, and spokesman for majority viewpoints. Nr. Abtyta was asked yesterday by The Times-Virglqian if he plan ned to attend the lflliQnal Conven tion of the Party in Chicago next month. He replied that his name may be on the list of Virginia delegates at large, but that he had not decided whether to attend or permit hie al ternate to represent him. It was considered likefy that Vir ginia will send an uninstructed dele gation to the national convention.

Abbitt said, Briefly the bill will limit the power of Federal judges to the issuing of injunctions and will guarantee to the citizens of this counltry a trial by jury in all con tempt proceedings other than mis behavior of any person in the pres ence of the court or so near there to as to obstruct the administration of justice and misbehavior of any of the officers of the court in their official transactions. The bill also provides certain safeguards as to who is guilty of contempt. Abbitt said in presenting the bill, It has become necessary that the Congress do something to protect the rights,4 privileges, and freedoms of the citizens of this country.
