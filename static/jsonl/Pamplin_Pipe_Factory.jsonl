There is also some evidence that a clay-pipe factory existed on the Dickerson property before 1879, but lack of records due to a fire at the county courthouse during that period of time has made this supposition difficult to substantiate. Dickerson and his wife, Nancy decided that the Pamplin clay pipe factory, falling into disrepair by the rnmmnmim fcr history Which should be. preserved. Thus, in 1976, they purchased the property from Charlie Ranson, and began restoring the structures which had once - housed the largest manufacturer of clay pipes in the United States.- . It wasnt easy. Dickerson recalls fighting rats and snakes, vandals, and jungle-like weeds that had cropped up around the factory since the business had closed down. But the Dickersons perserverance was greater than the forces of nature, and in July of 1978 the museum opened.  The original kiln, which in its heyday could hold as many as 200,000 clay pipes at one time, still stands on the museum grounds. The kilns chimney fell several years ago after continued abuse by vandals and Mother Nature. Im hoping to instore the chimney. says Dickerson. There is a chance t hat the property will be eligible for federal funding assistance if its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places is approved!  Dickerson hopes that he will be able to get some of this money to restore the chimney. Other than the possibility of federal funding to help restore the chimney, the most important thing about the historic landmarks designation to Dickerson is the recognition for Pamplin. Pamplin is a lovely place, says Dickerson. But in the last part of this century, its dried up. Theres so much history wrapped up in this town and in these clay pipes, history that involves the whole country? and the whold world. Something like that should be preserved, and hopefully in preserving it, we can contribute to the preservation of Pamplin.

In later times, especially during the Civil War, the pipes came to play a vital role in the survival of num erous low income families. The women and children made the pipes by hand in their backyards and sold them to local stores while their men fought in the war. Little did they know that their pipes were the beginnings of an industry that would one day claim to be the worlds sole producer of genuine Indian pipes. The home industrys process was really quite simple. They nearly merely mixed the clay with water to create the right texture, rolled it into the shape of a cigar, and placed it in the closed mold. Then the bowl- reamer tool, sometimes called a bowl stick was forced down into the bowl with a rotaing motion until the excess day was pushed into the shank. The shank stick was then inserted in the same way and removed. With the bowl stick still in place, the mold was opened and the pipe removed.
