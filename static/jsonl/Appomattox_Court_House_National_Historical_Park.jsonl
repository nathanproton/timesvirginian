The clinic, first of its kind ever held here, was at tended by Appomattox business people who have the opportunity to come in contact with the traveling public. The Tourist Trade Clinic was sponsored by the Distributive Edu cation Service at A. H. S., of which Jerry Miller is director the School Board, the Times-Virginian and the Junior Chamber of Commerce. Mrs. Julian Gilkeson, of the Vir ginia Travel Council was the open ing speaker at the clinic. She spoke en What the Tourist Industry Can Mean to Our Community. Citing facts gathered by the Travel Coun cil, she declared that the travel bus iness in Virginia is headed toward a goal of a billion dollars a year spent in the Old Dominion. She pointed to the Jamestown Festival of next year as an event that will bring three million extra tourists to the state, and that local communities in Virginia have an opportunity to tie in with this celebration of the 350th anniversary of Jamestown. Jerry Miller, D. E. Co-ordinator, then spoke on Courtesy to the Tour ist. He presented charts and draw ings to illustrate the value of ex tending every courtesy to the visitor in our midst. You use only 14 muscles irhen you smile, but over 60 when you frown, he declared. A briefing on Appomattoxs No. 1 Tourist Attraction, was given by H. A. Gurney, Superintendent of the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. He listed the typical questions that are asked by visitors from out-of-state, and suggested the answers to these questions. The idea was to brief local people on what to pass on in the way of information to the tourist. A number of questions from the audience brought out ad ditional facts that tourists wanted to know.  Ah   Trooper Pmul Hollingsworth, Vir- ginia State Police, gave an informa tive talk on Road Transportation and Information. Concluding the Clinic, was a sum mary by Calvin Robinson, editor of the Times-Virginian, on The Brass Tacks of Doing, Business With the Tourist. He declared that the 12 per person per day spent by the average tourist was worth going all- out for, and expressed the belief that Appomattox had a veritable gold mine at the Old Court House, and should try to get tourists to stop and spend mere time here.

The plan basically concerns itself with one tract of 22.19 acres along Route 24 in the north-western part of the park. The National Park Service currently hold a scenic easement of this tract, but because of ambiguities in the easement, some types of development - would be .-possible. The plan is recommending that either these development rights be acquired or that the lands be acquired in fee. The plan is available for review at park headquarters any weekday from 830 a.m. - 500 p.m. For additional informaiton, please call 352-8987."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Court", "House", "National", "Historical", "Park"], "snippet": "land protection plan for <mark>Appomattox</mark> <mark>Court</mark> <mark>House</mark> <mark>National</mark> <mark>Historical</mark> <mark>Park</mark>.

Through the courtesy of the Uni versity Fine Arts Division, the Guillaume painting was lent for ex hibit to the Randolph-Macon College Art Gallery, in June, 1954. A pro posal to purchase the painting and present it to the Park won wide public approval. Individuals and or ganizations in Lynchburg and Ap pomattox raiesd the necessary funds, 1,250, and the canvas was trans ferred to the Park Museum on July 1, 1954. At that time, Mr. Waiter Nitkie- wicz, painting restorer with the Mu seum Branch, National Park Service, examined the canvas and reported that it would require reinforcing. During the past winter months the Park Superintendent noticed in creased checking on the surface of the canvas, Mr. Nitkiewicz was call ed from Washington to report on the painting. Acting on his advice, and under his supervision, the paint ing was removed from the frame and crated preparatory to shipment for repairs. The National Park Service Mu seum Branch has assured Mr. Gur ney that every effort will be made to complete these repairs as quick ly as possible, in order to place the painting back on display."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Court", "House", "National", "Historical", "Park"], "snippet": "A.

Park historian Ken Apschnikat has prepared a short history of the pipes, part of which is publish ed here. by Ken Apschnikat, Park Historian Appomattox C.H. National Historical Park For thousands of years man has gained pleasure and relaxa tion from smoking tobacco in pipes. Various materials and methods have been used over the years for making pipes, but clay has been the fevorite. In central Virginia or the Piedmont area clay is of a fine quality for mak ing pipes. Its richness in iron oxide gives it a dark red color, and its consistency makes It id e a l. Particularly around Pamplin City in Southeast Appo mattox County the clay is re sponsible for the Interesting home and manufacturing indus try of making red clay pipes. Legends say the white men who first settled this area of Virginia learned this technique of pipe making from Indians who lived around the Pamplin area. Pipes were all home-made and made only for home use until 1739 when the Pamplin Smoking Pipe and Manufacturing Com pany, Inc. hereafter P.S.P.  Mfg. Co., Inc. was supposedly established in Pamplin City,ac cording to a letterhead. No exact date has been determined as to when the hom e-m adepipesbe gan to be made, but f olks In the area say for over 200 years. Regardless, manual clay pipe making is one of Americas old est Industries. Low income white women and Negro slaves made them for more than 50 years prior to the Civil War. A local legend says Negro slaves learned the art from an ag\u00e9d white man who was considered a hermit and sup ported himself by pipemaking. Even before the Civl War slav es of a rich old bachelor were aUowed to make a living making and seUing pipes. During the Civil War, pipemaking was an important source of income and survival for lower income white women. In early years red clay pipes were either bartered or sold to local g e n e r a l stores. These stores would in turn sell them at a small profit, or sell them wholesale to other general stor es in Piedmont Virginia. After the establishment of the P.S.P.  Mfg. Co., Inc. the local mak ers of these red clay pipes sold them to the company who then shipped them all over the coun try to catalog customers or wholesalers. Many were still sold by locals directly to gen eral stores.

H. A. Gurney, National Park Serv ice Superintendent at Old Appomat tox, today described progress of the restoration. Restoration of the Peers house should be completed by July 1. The residence was the home of George Peers, county court clerk. New comfort stations, in the re constructed slave quarters at the Old Tavern, will be completed this month and the Tavern itself is being given a handsome reconstruction job. It will be used for National Park Serv ice offices, and will house the enlarg ed museum. New museum exhibits are expect ed to arrive the week of April 18, to add to the many historical relics now on display. The museum has been located in the old Ferguson residence, where there hag not been room for adequate display. A continuous effort goes to ob tain museum items for Appomattox. Many of the items secured during the past year have been sent to Park Service shops to be prepared for ex hibit, and some of these items are now ready for public view. The mu seum in the restored Tavern is ex pected to be a mecca for tourists. Mr. Gurney announced today that 5,800 is now available for buildirg an utility house east of the Peers House. This will furnish storage space, workshop and housing for tools. Work will begin very soon on this project. The program of the Park Serv ice is a restoration of the Old Court Houte Village. The McLean House itself was the top item in the pro gram and-4to dedication brought one of the largest crowds ever in A ddo - mattox. StiH in the making are plans for rebuilding the ojd court house, which was located in the village circle, and was a center of county activity un til it burned in 1892. In Washington this week, final ap proval was voted for a change in the name of the National Park Serv- ice establishment here. The new name will be Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. This replaces the use of the word Monument in the designation, held to be an inadequate descrip tion of the restoration. The bill to change the name was introduced in ttie House by Congressman W. M. Abbitt. It has now passed both the House and Senate.
