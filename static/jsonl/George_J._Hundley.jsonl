D. Flood created a sensation by reading a letter from Judge George J. Hundley, of Farmville, addressed to the chairman of the Democratic S t a t e Central Committee, charging that Colonel Henry W. Anderson, in an address de livered at Farmville on August 30tb, had expressed himself as ashamed of the star in the United States flag which repre sented the State of Virginia. This astounding disclours fell as a thunder bolt upon the voters of the Fifth District who were present at the speaking. The letter, signed by Judge Hundley, the oldest circuit judge in Virginia, was written under date of September 9th. It was in reply to a communi cation from J. N. Brenaman, secretary of the Democratic State Committee. It reads in full, as follows Office of Geo. J. Hundley, Judge of the Fifth Judicial Cir cuit of Virginia. Farmville, Va , Sept. 9,1921. Hon. J. N. Brenaman, Sect. Democratic Committee, Richmond Va. My dear Mr. Brenaman Yours of the 6 th instant re ceived, and I write you, as ac curately as I can, what occur- at the time of Colonel Ander sons speech at Farmville. I note that you say the incident may be used by the committee. I have no objection to your using it,provided it is not based alone upon my statement, for it has been made public. It was published in the Farm ville Herald, and quoted and commented on by the Lynch burg News. I intended that it should be come buplic property, and that there should be no issue of veracity between him and my self, so I repeated to him what he had said, in the presence of the audience, and asked him if 1 had understood him correctly, and he admitted it. He saidWhen he was in the Balkans, trying to help and uplift those miserable people, he carried on the front of his automobile,the American Flag, and the women and chil dren would ccme up and kiss the flag, but that he was really ashamed to let them do this, for he felt that he was practic ing a fraud upon them, to al low them to kiss a flag having upon it a star representing the State of Virginia whose gov ernment was so unrepublican, so despotic, and so disgraceful as that of the State of Virginia. I waited quietly, until he closed, but before the audience dispersed, called upon him to explain thii.t statement, repeat ing what 1 had understood him to say. He did not deny it, but admitted it, with an awkward attempt to explain and which did not explain at all. I did not discuss anything with him but contented myself with Bay ing, Col. Anderson, there are men here who followed the flag of Virginia for four years in the Givil War, and those who fought for that Flag of ours in France, and shed their blood for it, and I want to say for them, that in all our history, there never has been a time, and there never will be a time, whilst the sun shines, that such a thing, as you have said, could be true of the Star repre senting our glorious old State on the Flag of our Common Country. W ith kind regards and best wishes, I am, Yours sincerely, Geo. J. Hundley. Judge Hundley, who presides over the fifth judicial circuit, is a veteran Virginia jurist and a veteran of the Givil War. He has a son, Lieutenant Robert G. Hundley, who saw service on the fighting front in France. Judge Hundley enlisted first with the Albemarle Howitiers, after which he served with the Fifth Vsrginia Infantry. He resigned from this regiment to enter the cavalry, in which arm of the service he remained until the close of the war be tween the states. He was seriously wounded while lead ing a cavalry charge. Lieutenant Robert G. Hund ley, also a war veteran, spilled bis blood in France in defense of the Stars and Stripes. His record was a brilliant one. He served with Company B., 306th Infantry, 77th Army Division with Company F., 120th Infan try, 30th Division, and with Company B., of the 369th New York. This latter regiment was brigaged with troops in the 161st French Army Divis ion, Fourth French Army. Lieutenant Hundley, who is now stumping for the Demo cratic ticket, was deeperately wounden in the campaign offensive on September 30th., 1918. Four major operations were performed on him and for some time his life was diapaired of. He saw eleven months active service in the Western front in France."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["George", "J", "Hundley"], "snippet": "a letter from Judge <mark>George</mark> <mark>J</mark>. <mark>Hundley</mark>, of Farmville, addressed to"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["George", "J", "Hundley"], "snippet": "a letter from Judge <mark>George</mark> <mark>J</mark>. <mark>Hundley</mark>, of Farmville, addressed to"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Flood to suc ceed himself as Senator from this district, iu a speech which was well received, by the audience, and which elicited much applause, showing plainly that the audience endorsed his eulogistic remarks on Mr. Flood and his record as a representative. Mr. Gray is a pleasant speaker, aud his remarks were timely and highly appreciative. Mr, A. B. Thornhill, of Appomat tox, in a beautiful speech, seconded the nomination of Mr. Flood. He referred to the magnanimity with which Mr. Flood refused the certifi cate of election to Congress in 1896, and presented figures showing that iie received 4,000 more votes than diu Mr. Tucker in 1894, and 6,000 more than did Mr. Quarles in 1898. Mr. Thornhills remarks made a good impressiou, and he was the re cipient of congratulations upon his peech. Messrs. F. C. Moon and Ednt. W. Hubard, ou the part of Bucking ham, made short speeches seconding the nomination. At the conclusion of these speech es Mr. Paul Pettit moved that the nomination be made by acclamation, which was adopted, and the chair appointed Messrs. Gray, Thornhill, and Hubard to iuform Mr. Flood of his nomination, and to present him to the convention. Mr. Flood accepted the nomina tion in a speech of twenty minutes, which aroused much enthusiasm. He assured the peopie of his appie- fiaaou of the honor conferred, and of their endorsement and loyalty, to him and his public acts. He spoke earnestly of the faithful service to the laboring people of Virginia ren dered by Senator Martin, aud of the light he made for him in the Demo cratic caucus six years ago, assuring the Democracy of Virginia that, if- they would lay the mantle of the seuatorship upon Mr. Martin at that time, the Democracy of the Old Do minion would approve their action. Mr. Flood referred to the large ma jority of counties having gone for Senator Martin as proving the truth of his prediction, and said that Mr. Martin would be renominated by a four-fifths majority. At the con clusion of his speech he was pre sented wit-h a bouquet of beautiful flowers. Mr. F. 0. Moon offered the follow ing resolutions, which weie unani mously adopted Resolved, That the course of Hon. T. S. Martin, United States Senator, is fully endorsed and approved and the nomiuee of this convention is in structed to vote for and support Him for re-election to that position. . 2d, That the tiominee of this con vention is instructed to vote for and support Hon.

For seven years he haB presided over our Court and by his courageous, im partial and efficient discharge of duty and dispatch of business, lie has won laurels and added dignity to the judicial ermine, and his name will form a strong connect ing link in the chain of  irginiaa distinguished Judiciary.  As evi dence of his eminent fitness and qualifications for the position, we refer with pride to the fact that during seven years administration of justice, he has only been re versed four tims. Judge Hundley is a man of ability, experience and culture a first class lawyer, aid we hope the time will never come in Virginia when the General Assembly will torn out an able and efficient judge simply to give place to an other who wants the office.

At the close of the war he com menced the practice of law and soon attained high rank in his pro fession.

It is no secret that an effort is being made in certain quarters to defeat the reelection of Judge Handley and this is the response of the law yers. What have the people of Aj pomattox to say on this important subject? Perhaps if Judge H und ley is to be defeated they will wain to know the reason why. The peo ple do not elect their judges di rectly, but they do elect the men who elect the judges. The lawyer are not the only people interested it the election of capable, impartial and fearless judgesjudges who have the honesty and the courage ti administer law without respect to persons and before whom all men stand upon a level so long as they obey the laws of the land. The election of Governors and Senators is very important, but these are far removed from the people. Thei judges touch them more nearly than any other officials, No man can estimate the harm that a weak and oscilating judgeone courting the favor of men of power and influence, may do, aud in such cases it is the good, plain, indus trious people w ho suffer. The law yers know the law and can protect themselves in a measure, but the plain people want to feel when they fie down to sleep at night that a fearless, independent and upright judge stands between them and all wrong and injustice. Thank God, the people are free once more, since the shadow of negro domination is removed far from them, and we are about to return to the old order of things, when politicians were the servants and not the masters of the people.

Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Ground bog weather still lingeis with us. It will be a many long weary year ere the believer in the accuracy of his hog-ships predictions can be otherwise persuaded. For if ever weather up held the believer in these forecast ings by the ground hog, the weath of the past month has supported this contention. It is a common remark that the weather only mod erates to turn colder. This morn ing dawns upon ns with evil fore bodingspromising more of the same old samer. Grippe has had full sway, in no sense being respector of persons but attacking the high and low the rich and ppor entering the mansion as well as the bedaubed hut. Laying his excru ciating hand upon the weak aud feeble as well as upon the strong and robust. And when we come to think of it, when his appearance made it is not soon forgotten We do not think we will soon con found the disease of bad cold and the once felt, never-to-be-forgotten grippe. We shall never reckon them as two distinct diseases. Mr. and Mrs. P. A. Forbes, who have been very unwell for quite awhile are just a little improved Though Mr. Forbes is expected fo go to Richmond on Wednesday next to consult a specialist in re gard to his sufferings. The two daughters of Mr. J. H Fitzgerald, Misses Fannie and Re beckah, who have been ill with pneumonia, at the Stonewall Jack- son school, at Abingdon, Virginia, where their mother, Mrs. Eva F itz gerald has been in attendance upon them for several weeks past, are so much better as to warrant the effort on the part of the mother to briug them home today. Mr. J. W. Word is confined to his room fiom the effects of severe carbuncles on his head and neck. He is reported to he no better this morning. Mr. P. A. Grigg is con fined to the house with severe cold and eruptions on his hands. He to unimproved this morning. Judge George J. Hundley, who was so unwell just as the term of Court, was winding up here, and who was confined to his bed for sev eral days thereafter, was so much improved that, in company, with Mrs. Hundley, he left on Friday last for his home near Farmville. Mrs. Virginia Hill, whose illness has been heretofore alluded to, is uow so weak as to be unable to sit up at all. Her age and the serious uature of her complaint, cause her friends and relatives to be very un easy about her. We learn with sincere pleasure that the condition of Mrs. Nannie F. Ellis, who has been quite ill with pneumonia, is somewhat improved. Mrs. Ada C. Gilliam is extremely ill with grippe at her horn 3 near Togs. Nearly all the members  her household are reported as more or less complaining, It seems tha . this disease goes through a familv when once it enters it. I take this opportunity of tender ing m y thanks to Mr. W. P. Ellis for letting me down so gently. It iB just like the couiteous gentle man he is to take a fellow to taw and then concede all of his eonten - tions. He and I have no quarrel witheach other any way. I will however endeavor to disabuse hi-, mind of an apparent lingering im pression that I undertook to criti cise the James r m r dist. Justice. I d this he is clear off. I would sim.Jy say that when a fellow undertakes to make a circle he necessarily touches on four lines, which form  square but his purpose is not to make the square bnt the circle. I therefore purposed to justify my coarse in the James River deer- hunting episode and,not to condemn my respected Jamas River associate justice.
