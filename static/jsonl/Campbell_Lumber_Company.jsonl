Mr. Frank McKinney, a promi nent and well known farmer orAppo- mattox county, who was in the city a few days ago, stated to a reporter of The News that the road over which the farmers of his section had to haul their tobacco and other farm products into Lynchburg, was in a fearful condition and that its use was not only attended by ex traoi din ary dfficulties bnt was actually a menace to the safety of man and beast. The road referred to by Mr. McKinney is the old Richmond turn pike that enters the city by way of Tyreeanna and np the bank of the river. It is nsed by the farmers throughout a large section of the conutry, including tbe entire county f Appomattox, a large part of Camp-, bell, a part of Buckingham, Prince Edward, and other counties still further remote. To Lynchburg the road is probably of as much value as any other that enters the city, hundreds of thousands of pounds of tobacco being brought over it an nually into the city. This road has be\u00e9n owned and op- perated for years by a company, many of the stockholders of which reside in the North. The heavy rain that occurred last fall caused considerable damage to the road, and in particular rendered the bridges very unsafe for travel. One of the bridges, the one across Beaver creek, was taken down, and although the lumber was hauled there preparatory for its reconstruction, it has not been ebuilt and farmers in hauling their goods to town haye a fearful ravine to cross, and to do this they have to leave the main road and by u tortuous, narrow and to some exteht danger ous road, go consideiahly out of their way around by the Six Mile Bridge. This side road is s  narrow and so steep in places that if two teams should be traversing it at tbe same time ip opposite directions, it would be absolutely impossible for them to pass without running the risk of an accident It is said that many of the farmers n coming to town with heavily loaded wagons are compelled to procure assistance to push their wagons over the bad places in the road. The bridge over Possnm creek, which is about a mile this side of the Six Mile bridge, has been condemmed. but it has not been fixed, and asa consequence the farmers at this point have to cross tbe deep ravine, straining their horses and themselves in climbing the steep banks. Such a condition of things is characterized by the farmers who use the road as outrageous and uni versal indignation is being expressed. Last fall, by the action of the Camp bell county court, the company was compelled to throw open their toll gate, and since that time no tolls have been charged. It is very probable that a move ment will be made by the Campbell authorities to compel the company either to repair the road, as it should be, or abandon their charter. Its present condition is undoubtedly a menace to the safety of the farmer and his teams, and is by no means advantageous to the citys business. It is stated by those in a position to know, that many farmers rather than come over the road are taking their tobacco to other places instead of to Lynchburg.Lynchburg News. Not a few of our farmers testify to the absolute correctness of this statement made by Mr. McKinney, who is probably better acquainted with onr roads  an any other man in tbe county. The fact is we have no road sjstem at all for this county. We shall be glad to hear from those who have systems, and with the proper disenssion and enlight- ment on this important subject we may have a plan adopted which will give general satisfaction."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Campbell", "company"], "snippet": "be made by the <mark>Campbell</mark> authorities to compel the <mark>company</mark> either to repair the"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Campbell", "company"], "snippet": "be made by the <mark>Campbell</mark> authorities to compel the <mark>company</mark> either to repair the"}], "text_match": 1733921019300675705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2216192573440", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1733921019300675705", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Two large factories owned and oper ated by Suhling  Co., Lynchburg, were destroyed by fife. When the alarm was given flames were issuing from the tops of both structures, and before the firemen got to work all ef forts to save them were hopeless. Many nearby factories were in danger.
