We the Democra tic. County Committee, therefore address this appeal to the Democratic voters of the county. The Democratic Party is in power in the Nation, State and County. By reason of the splendid and patriotic administration of President Wilson it is likely to re main in power in the nation for years to come. By reason of its splendid administration in State affairs for many years, its lease on power in the State of Virgina is indefinite. No less indefinite is the control of Appomattox County by that Party, because its control has enured -to the benefit of the people and the upbuilding of the county. Since 1902 there has been no serious opposition to the Democratic party in tjhis county and the result has been a great development in our county along all lines. Ve notice published in the Times-Virginian, a call is made by Dr. D. Mott Robertson inviting the people to attend a meeting at Appomattox Court House on Friday, August 20th, for the pur pose of nominating a full ticket in opposition to the ticket nominated in the Democratic primary. This movement purports to be by independents but from the personnel of the leaders it smacks of Republicanism. The call invites all voters of the county to attend who believe in low taxes the election of Dis trict School superintendents and school trustees by the people who are opposed to the issuing of county bonds and who favor the one-room schools having as long session as the other schools. These are general propositions, without details of how their accomplishment can be brought about, and probably many of the voters are in favor ,of one or more of them. Certainly everybody is in favor of a lower tax rate if the governmental affairs can be run on such a rate without seriously impairing the progress of the State or County. Many of our citizens are in favor of election of district school superintendents and school trus tees by the people, and we have no doubt if a sufficient number of citizens would so petition, the re presentative ot this county would introduce in the Legislature an amendment to the Constitution providng for the election of district school superintendents by the people, and upon a similar petition would introduce a bil in the legislature providing for the election of school trustees by the people. There is no question before the people as to the issue of county bonds as there is no need for or demand for such an issue in bur county. We have no doubt every citizen of Appomattox would be in favor of the one-room schools having as long sessions as the other schools of the county if that could be done without increasing the rate of taxation or reducing the length of session of the other schools. The call is inconsistent in that on one hand he advocates lower taxation and on the other a larger expenditure for school purposes. You may get one but you cannot get both you cant have longer school sessions without paying an additional amount of money for them and this money comes in the shape of taxes from the people. Our Democratic Nominees will go before the voters at the November election upon their re cords with the belief that the masses of the people, who think at all, have approved and will ratify their policy by reelecting them. Neither will the voters be misled by any insinuations and fault-find ing proclamations, of that coterie of citizens who are out of office, and public favor, and who are seek ing an issue upon which to get in. We appeal to the Democrats and the thoughtful independent voters not to allow the Republican leaders of the county and a lew disappointed Democrats to lead them into the Republican party."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["D", "Mott", "Robertson"], "snippet": "is made by Dr. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Mott</mark> <mark>Robertson</mark> inviting the people to"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["D", "Mott", "Robertson"], "snippet": "is made by Dr. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Mott</mark> <mark>Robertson</mark> inviting the people to"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The negro then folded the ticket up and without makiug the slightest com plaint voted it. He weut out and iu about ten minutes Mr. E. F.

After short interval Collins, D.

Whorley also signed this statement, but later scratched his name off as he was one of the Commissioners of Election.

He complains about the debts we fowe for school buildings. The bool hoards of the County do owe ePLlterary Fund for money bor rowed to aid in building the Appo- mattox high school, the Stonewall high school, and the graded schools at Oakville, Tower Hill, Vera, and Pamplin, but they are paying what they owe as it falls due, and the in terest on what they owe, out of the school levy, and will continue to do so. We also owe the Literary Fund for part of the money necessary to build the dormitory at Appomattox but we borrowed tiffs money on 15 years time at 3 interest, and the small rental charged teachers t and scholars for rooms in this dormitory will pay the interest and retire the debt as jt matures. This is un doubtedly a good business proposi tion, but no sound business proposi tion ever penetrated the head of D. Mott Robertson. The Appomattox high school, in eluding grounds, building, and equipment, has cost not less than 30,000, over twice as much as the court-house and jail cost. The County of Appomattox has only subscribed 2,000 of this amount. The rest of it was given by the State subscribed by patriotic citizens, anc borrowed from the State. The original amount we borrowed to build this school was 7,500. The interest on this and 4,500 of the principal has been paid out of the school levy. Future interest and the other 3,000 will be paid in the same way. A safe business proposition oi! this kind in the interest of the children of Appomattox County does not appeal to D. Mott Robertson because he is opposed to the children of any part of the County havin the same advantages the children of other counties have at least, his letter justifies the conclusion that such is his opposition. We are for the schools, for good schools all over the County, and with the present rate of taxation, before many years roll around we will have good schools within the reach of every child in the County, . Dr. Robertson alludes with much bombast to the time when he was Treasurer, as if he ran the whole business. We know that the Boar of Supervisors to which he refers Messrs. Ligon, Thornhill, and Jones were .capable and honest officials and progressive men, and un doubtedly would have done more for the development of the County if Dr. Robertson had promptly paid over the taxes he collected.

A right pretty political fight is to take place in this county for the clerkship, which is the best-paid office within the gift of our jieople The present clerk holds od for two more years, and then the will be made for an eight-year term Dr. D. Mott Robertson, late county- treasurer, who resigned that office last summer, has announced to sono of his friends that he will stand fo the Democratic nomination for tb clerkship, and that he will, if elect ed, run the office for the fees alone This would be a saving to the tax payers of nearly 600 per annum, or nearly 5,000 for th\u00e8 term. The election is some distance be fore us, and it is not our purpose to stir up the candidates or the people upon the subject thus early  but we shall fill the field of a newspaper and keep our readers informsd of events as they occur.

Mr. J Rolfe Horsley, whom Mr. Peers de feated for the office in 1899, is also likely to be a candidate. Mr. Hors ley last Week resigned the position of private secretary to Congressman Flood, which oarried a salary of 1, 200 per annum paid by Congress and assumed the management of the Southside Virginian. The resigna tion of Mr. Horsley probably caused Dr. Robertsons early announcement of his candidacy. We are satisfied that there will be other candidates. The people are being quietly sounded as to thiB and that man, bat the great majority of them will hardly bind themselves to any one at this stage of the game- none, perhaps, except a few whc be lieve that they ought to be allowed  to shape all the public policies of the connty, and to name all of the officeholders years in advance of the election.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

To the Voters of Appomattox County The long communication of Dr. D. Mott Robertson, published in the T imes -V irginian of October 20th, and covering three columns, is so full of misrepresentations and false conclusions that we deem it neces sary in the interest of truth to reply to it. Dr. Robertson, towards the con elusion of his article, says Mr Good Citizen, if you believe that 1 havq shown wherein the Board of Supervisors has misrepresented the facts in their circular, I ask you to go to the polls on November the 2d and Cast your vote to rebuke such an administration.  This is a direct charge that our circular issued to the voters of Ap pomattox County contained mis representations. I f we have, let Mr Good Citizen vote against us. Ii Dr. Robertson has, let Mr. Good Citizen administer to the Doctor the medicine he has prescribed, and go to the polls on next Tuesday ant. vote against him and the ticket he has put in the field. First. The Robertson letter at tacks our statement in reference to the tax rate. We stated that the tax rate for County and State purposes in 1914 was the same that it was in 1901 when Dr. Robertson was Treasurer. We further stated that the rate for school purposes was 15c on the 100 worth of property in 1901 and 50c in 1914. Dr. Robertson claims that that statement is incorrect, and undertakes to mislead his readers by mixing the tax rate for school pur poses with that for Coupty purposes, when we have distinctly separatee the two. We thought even D. Mott Robert son could understand this distinc tion. We were aware of his habit of always muddling things and espe cially matters relating to finances and more especially when it was tc his interest to muddle them, but we did not see and do not now see, how he understood our circular as he pretends in his letter to have mis understood it. You will observe that iu his letter he fixes the rate of County taxation in 1901 at 80c. He embraces in this the 15c levied for school purposes. Deducting 15c from the 80c, leaves the tax rate for County purposes 65c. The rate of State taxation _ 1901 was 40c. Add 40c to 65c and it makes 1.05, which was levied ii 1901 for State and County purposes, outside of the County levy for school purposes. The rate of taxation ir 1914 outside of that levied for schoo. purposes is 70c, the State rate was 35c, making 1.05 for County and State purposes, outside of the County levy for school purposes. The two figures are exactly the samejust what we said in our circular. Now we 88k the people Who is undertaking to misrepresent the facts? Second. Dr. Robertson takes - sue with the Board in the wisdom of having built some improved roads with ffie aid, not only of the State, but of private subscriptions. He seems to think that it is both illegal and immoral to have done so. That such a course was legal is evidenced by the fact that it is approved by the laws of Virginia that it is perfectly moral is recognized by everybody but Dr. Robertson. The State of Virginia enacted some laws for the permanent im provement of roadb and bridges. Other laws provide that it would put up one-half of the money or a convict force for the building 0f these roads and bridges. The County of Appomattox at first accepted money, and, with the money gotten from the State and supplemented by just as much from the County treasury, built seven permanent bride As County at"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["D", "Mott", "Robertson"], "snippet": "long communication of Dr. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Mott</mark> <mark>Robertson</mark>, published in the T"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["D", "Mott", "Robertson"], "snippet": "long communication of Dr. <mark>D</mark>. <mark>Mott</mark> <mark>Robertson</mark>, published in the T"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

In the Tenth Congressional district there is but one county in which there appears to be strong opposition to the Demo cratic nominee for the House of Delegates and that county is Appomattox. Hon. R L Burke is the present represent stive in the House from Appo m atter county and is the nomi nee of the Democratic party for re-election. Dr. D. Mott Robertson is opposing Mr Burke and we believe is the nominee of some party, the name of which is not recogniz ed by either Republicans or Democrats. During the one term be has s e r v e d in the House of Delegates Mr. Burke has given a good account of himself. He is acquainted with legislative machinery, is popu lar with the members, about fifty per cent of whom will be admitted to the Democratic caucus and given important committee assignments. His opponent will have no such op portunity u serve his constitu ents in theeventof his election, which we trust is doubtful. For these-sod added reasons, the people of Appomattox conn ty should return D e l e g a t e Burke to the House by an in creased m ajority. There is nothing to gain by electing Dr. Robertson, who is an untried man in the halls of legislation. Besides, the last named gentle man is not a Democrat and would be very much like a fish out of water when it came to securing any legislation for the benefit of his people. We can bear testimony to the fact that Mr. Burke was attentive to hii duties in the last House. H was punctual on the see sions of the larger body and seldom missed a meeting of any of his committees. If oar memory is not at fault, he missed few roll calls, thus showing his deep interest in the work he wsb called upon to perform for his county. The good people of Appomattox county will make a mistake if they fail to vote for Mr. Burke, a m istake we trust they will not be led into On the night of the election we hope to hear of oar friend victory and by such a majority that it will forever bury the op position to Democracy in the county above mentioned."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["D", "Mott", "Robertson"], "snippet": "party for re-election.

Mott Robertson Makes Statement. My duty to the citizens of Appo mattox county and my duty to my self impels me to make reply to this statement. In this article, Dr. Robertson, re ferring to the election in 1915 for the Treaanryahip of Appomattox connty, uses the following langnage Now, Mr. Voter, yon can see that we were defeated by this illegal act, logether with the illegal act of Mr. A. H How erton, who claimed that the law said the nnnsed ballots most be burnt. Read the law below and yon will see that the word burn does not occur save in the imagination of Mr. A. H How erton, who evidently wished to procure some ballots for some purpose known only to himself and his allies. Briefly stated, the facts, insofar as my connection with said election e concerned, are as follows I was one of the three judges of election at the precinct known as Oheatwood. When the p o l l s closed, I and the other judges pres ent were of the opinion that the unnaed ballots should be burnt. As matter of fact the statute do s not use the word burnt, hut uses the word destroyed. It is true that the ballots we-e not destroyed be fore the ballot-box was opened, be cause, being under the impression that they should be burned, it was thought wisest not to burn them on the inside of the old and dilapi dated house in which the election was being held. They were, how- ver, turned over to Mr. 8. P. Oole- man, jr , who in a short time there after, and on the outside of the house, burnt them, with two of the judges present witneeeing the burn mg. The failure of myself and the other judges to destroy these ballots before opening the ballot box bad absolutely no effect whatever upon the resalt of the election at that precinct, for the simple reason that not one of the an used ballots was ever used for any improper purpose, each and every one of them being destroyed. There were only two candidates for Treasurer, Mr. R. F. Burke,who was elected, and Dr. D. Mott Rob ertson, who was defeated. At m precinct of Oheatwood, Hr. Bnrke only received eight votes, which were counted for him, and I am hereto attaching the signed state ment of the eight men who vofed for him on that occasioo We, wnose names are signed to this pap -r, do certify that we voted for R. F. Bnrke for Treasurer of Appomattox Goan- tv, Virginia, in the General Election held in November, LSI 5, at Oheatwood precinot, Appomattox connty, Va. This September 19,1917.  Signed 8. P.
