He has been a member of the General As sembly since he was 22 years old. He is chairman of the committee on Fish and Game of the Senate, second on Privileges and Elections, fourth on Courts of Justice, and is a mem berof the Committee on Printing. He is a close attendant upon the ses sions of his committees and a good worker. He was the leader in the Senate of those who favored our present election laws, without radi cal changes, and made one of the ablest speeches on this, subject that has been made in the Senate. In his defence of our election laws he was supported by many of the stron gest senators. He isbold and aggressive in what ever he advocates, and rarely fails in his undertakings. He represents a section in which party feeling is higher than in any other sectiou of the State, and the last contest in his district was very bitter but the re suit was a splendid triumph for Mr. Flood. He carried the district by I, 000. which was lost by the Demo crats in 1894. He has a large and extensive law practice, which he never neglects for anything except to perform his political duties. He is considered particularly strong as a jury lawyer. As Attorney for the Commonwealth for his county he has been particularly successful, rarely ever failing to secure a convic tion when he asks for it. Mr. Flood is spoken of as a for - midable candidate for Congress in the coming fight.

Reared in a home of culture and refinement, educated in the best schools of the I State,experienced in legislative work, he is fully qualified for the position. The distinction he has attained was not won through the influence of relatives of wide political reputation, but by his own individual worth, and because his constituents recog nized in him a man of broad sympa thy,superior talents, and the power j to make those talents trusted. While a member of the lower and the upper branch of the Legislature, he made every endeavor to win the approbation of his constituents, and I their endorsement of him for I Congress testifiied that his work was not in vain.

Gallagher said he believed if Dempsey was home the strike would be won, but Beatty said he thought not. I heard Gallager say Tom Brady first sug gested croton oil. On Dec. 4 1 overheard a talk between Gallagher and Beatty, which was about the same as the former one. Beatty said Turkish rhubarb end snuff was in tha powders and it was not necessary to tell the rest. Gallagher said he could take the powders and go west add break np some strike there, and told Beatty to go to Homestead next day and get the receipt if he had to pay five dollars, as there was money to it for both of them.  Louis Welters, steward of the restaurant to tbe Homestead mill, testified that he noticed unaccountable sickness soon after employing Gallagher as a cook.

AJao, under tbe Cannon rnles, tbe Speaker was chairman of the power ful committee on rules, and since he bad the appointment of his brother members on that committee, he ac tually controlled the shaping aDd direction of all legislation brought before the House. Under the pre sent rales, not only is the Speaker shorn of bis former autocratic power to appoint members of com mittees, and thns to control the ac tion of the committees, bnt he him self is not permitted to be a member of the committee on roles. Not content with the above-men tioned changes, the House progres sives adopted certain rnles which changed the committees from arbi trary bodies to advisory bodies, and which greatly enlarged the power and influence of the individual members of the Honse. For in stance, under the Cannon rnles, the chairman of a committee could practically prevt a vote being taken on a measure which had been referred to bis committee while un der the prednt rules, although a committee cnairman is influential and powerful when it comes to shaping legislation coming before his committi e, he cannot prevent thy Honse from voting as to whet her or not a measure shall pass the House. The standpat Republicans, toget her with a few reactionary Demo crata, most of whom have since been retired to the shades of private life, fought hard againss the revision of the Cannon rnle, bnt tbey were overwhelmingly defeated, the new rnles were adopted, and Cannon- ism took its place among the things that used to be. In the fighting that preceded tbe final victories of the progressives in the lower Honse of Congress, Mr. Flood was always on the firing line, and he, together with Bepresenta tives A. Mitchell Palmer of Penn sylvania, Clande Kitchin of North Carolina, and James Hay of Vir ginia, ably assisted Bepresentative Oscar W. Underwood of Alabama in the bringing about of those pro gressive reforms that practically re stored to the people the power to shape legislation in the halls of Congress. Previously, when tbe Bepnbli- cans were in control of the Honse, Mr. Flood had frequently attacked the reactionaries who had entrench ed themselves behind the Gannon rnles, and on one occasion when the infamy of those rnles was under discussion on the floor of the Honse, particularly with reference to their application to a bill for the relief of the tobacco growers of Virginia, the member from the Tenth Dist rict, himself the author of a mea sure having for its purpose the re- ief of the Virginia growers, rose in his seat, and by the grace of Mr. Speaker Cannon, delivered a most forctble address in which he scored the antocratic power exercised by the Cannon regime, which, be re marked, had taken from the mem bers of the HonBe the powers dele gated to them by the Federal Con stitntion. Space does not permit me to give yon more than a taste of the milit ant progressivism with which that particular speech was charged, so 1 must content myself with quoting one small paragraph, reserving for my next weeks letter a fuller ac count of the speech, whioh itself alone stamps Henry D. Flood as one of that band of active progres sives whose efforts jrill be a step nearer fnll fruition when Woodrow Wil.on takes his sent in the White Honse. Mr. Flood said When Oliver Cromwell cleared ont liie Parliinent Honse with a file of soldier, it whb no whit more tyranmoal, no whit moie subversive sf the fundamental principles of representative government, than this aeeumptiou of a power which should only be exercised by a ma jority of -this Honse,namely tbe power to legislate.

Harwood Caldwell, whose death occured on June 24th, 1955 . Public spirited to a high degree she was an unfailing worker in all good causes. Over the years every progressive movement in Church and community has owed much to her support, for Bessie V. was a leader in educational, health, recreational, and civic activities. From early youth she was a faithful and devot ed member of Liberty Baptist Church, and was a pillar of strength in its organizations and Church life. We pay tribute to her life of in spiration and accomplishments. She was devoted to her children, family, and home always loyal to her friends true to her convictions strong in her Christian faith, and optimistic in her outlook. Even unto the end her thoughts and plans were in consideration of others. In spite of her progressing ill. ness she kept up with her usual in terests with a courageous spirit. In no greater way did she exemplify her bravery than in her efforts to seek and use every known means of medical treatment, not solely for the purpose of her own recovery but also that others similiarly strick en might be helped. Though she is gone, always in our midst is she because Love makes memory eternal. Mrs. Robert C. Hubbard Mrs. Joel W. Flood Mrs. Jerry A. Burke, Chairman Resolution Committee.
