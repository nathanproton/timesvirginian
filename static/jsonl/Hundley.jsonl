D. Flood created a sensation by reading a letter from Judge George J. Hundley, of Farmville, addressed to the chairman of the Democratic S t a t e Central Committee, charging that Colonel Henry W. Anderson, in an address de livered at Farmville on August 30tb, had expressed himself as ashamed of the star in the United States flag which repre sented the State of Virginia. This astounding disclours fell as a thunder bolt upon the voters of the Fifth District who were present at the speaking. The letter, signed by Judge Hundley, the oldest circuit judge in Virginia, was written under date of September 9th. It was in reply to a communi cation from J. N. Brenaman, secretary of the Democratic State Committee. It reads in full, as follows Office of Geo. J. Hundley, Judge of the Fifth Judicial Cir cuit of Virginia. Farmville, Va , Sept. 9,1921. Hon. J. N. Brenaman, Sect. Democratic Committee, Richmond Va. My dear Mr. Brenaman Yours of the 6 th instant re ceived, and I write you, as ac curately as I can, what occur- at the time of Colonel Ander sons speech at Farmville. I note that you say the incident may be used by the committee. I have no objection to your using it,provided it is not based alone upon my statement, for it has been made public. It was published in the Farm ville Herald, and quoted and commented on by the Lynch burg News. I intended that it should be come buplic property, and that there should be no issue of veracity between him and my self, so I repeated to him what he had said, in the presence of the audience, and asked him if 1 had understood him correctly, and he admitted it. He saidWhen he was in the Balkans, trying to help and uplift those miserable people, he carried on the front of his automobile,the American Flag, and the women and chil dren would ccme up and kiss the flag, but that he was really ashamed to let them do this, for he felt that he was practic ing a fraud upon them, to al low them to kiss a flag having upon it a star representing the State of Virginia whose gov ernment was so unrepublican, so despotic, and so disgraceful as that of the State of Virginia. I waited quietly, until he closed, but before the audience dispersed, called upon him to explain thii.t statement, repeat ing what 1 had understood him to say. He did not deny it, but admitted it, with an awkward attempt to explain and which did not explain at all. I did not discuss anything with him but contented myself with Bay ing, Col. Anderson, there are men here who followed the flag of Virginia for four years in the Givil War, and those who fought for that Flag of ours in France, and shed their blood for it, and I want to say for them, that in all our history, there never has been a time, and there never will be a time, whilst the sun shines, that such a thing, as you have said, could be true of the Star repre senting our glorious old State on the Flag of our Common Country. W ith kind regards and best wishes, I am, Yours sincerely, Geo. J. Hundley. Judge Hundley, who presides over the fifth judicial circuit, is a veteran Virginia jurist and a veteran of the Givil War. He has a son, Lieutenant Robert G. Hundley, who saw service on the fighting front in France. Judge Hundley enlisted first with the Albemarle Howitiers, after which he served with the Fifth Vsrginia Infantry. He resigned from this regiment to enter the cavalry, in which arm of the service he remained until the close of the war be tween the states. He was seriously wounded while lead ing a cavalry charge. Lieutenant Robert G. Hund ley, also a war veteran, spilled bis blood in France in defense of the Stars and Stripes. His record was a brilliant one. He served with Company B., 306th Infantry, 77th Army Division with Company F., 120th Infan try, 30th Division, and with Company B., of the 369th New York. This latter regiment was brigaged with troops in the 161st French Army Divis ion, Fourth French Army. Lieutenant Hundley, who is now stumping for the Demo cratic ticket, was deeperately wounden in the campaign offensive on September 30th., 1918. Four major operations were performed on him and for some time his life was diapaired of. He saw eleven months active service in the Western front in France."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Hundley"], "snippet": "from Judge George J. <mark>Hundley</mark>, of Farmville, addressed to"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Hundley"], "snippet": "from Judge George J. <mark>Hundley</mark>, of Farmville, addressed to"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

To the General Assembly of Vir ginia, In obedience to law it will be your duty to elect a successor to judge George J. Hundley as Judge of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, and it is with pleasure and confidence that we. the nndersignea resident and practicing attorney 8 in the Cir cuit present, the claims of Judge Hundley for re election. For seven years he haB presided over our Court and by his courageous, im partial and efficient discharge of duty and dispatch of business, lie has won laurels and added dignity to the judicial ermine, and his name will form a strong connect ing link in the chain of  irginiaa distinguished Judiciary.  As evi dence of his eminent fitness and qualifications for the position, we refer with pride to the fact that during seven years administration of justice, he has only been re versed four tims. Judge Hundley is a man of ability, experience and culture a first class lawyer, aid we hope the time will never come in Virginia when the General Assembly will torn out an able and efficient judge simply to give place to an other who wants the office. His R ecord A s a S oldier . He enlisted at the commence meat of the war was a gallant sol dier, serving throughout the war, and was dangerously wounded in battle. His R ecord A s a C itizen . At the close of the war he com menced the practice of law and soon attained high rank in his pro fession. He has been a .lifelong Democrat and as such served in the House of Delegates and Senate of Virginia and until his electon as Judge was one of the most active and efficient State canvassers for the Democratic party. The accom panying papers will demonstrate tha be is overwhelmingly the choioe of the bar, officers of court and people in the Circuit, and we confidently rely upon his re-election in accordance with precedent under such circumstances, and as a jus tribute to merit and worth. E. W. H dbard , Commonwealths Attorney of Buckingham. W m . M. S mith , Commonwealths Attorney and late County Judge of Cumberland, Vo. A. H. C lement , of Appomattox bar. A. B. A rmstro  o , of Prince Ed ward bar. We pnblish as a matter of news the above petition signed by a com mittee representing, as we are in formed more than three-fourths of the resident bar of this Circuit and about seven-eighths of all the law yers practicing in this cncuit. It is no secret that an effort is being made in certain quarters to defeat the reelection of Judge Handley and this is the response of the law yers. What have the people of Aj pomattox to say on this important subject? Perhaps if Judge H und ley is to be defeated they will wain to know the reason why. The peo ple do not elect their judges di rectly, but they do elect the men who elect the judges. The lawyer are not the only people interested it the election of capable, impartial and fearless judgesjudges who have the honesty and the courage ti administer law without respect to persons and before whom all men stand upon a level so long as they obey the laws of the land. The election of Governors and Senators is very important, but these are far removed from the people. Thei judges touch them more nearly than any other officials, No man can estimate the harm that a weak and oscilating judgeone courting the favor of men of power and influence, may do, aud in such cases it is the good, plain, indus trious people w ho suffer. The law yers know the law and can protect themselves in a measure, but the plain people want to feel when they fie down to sleep at night that a fearless, independent and upright judge stands between them and all wrong and injustice.
