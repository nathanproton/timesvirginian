At the same time, these leading growers, through their cooperative efforts in handling the surplus, have caused an increased demand tor that portion of the crop sold over the auction floors which has netted the growers over 75 per cent more than pre-war price. During the four years which the cooperative association has operated, there has been a grad ual decrease in the production ot dark fired tobacco in spite of the comparatively good prices which were being paid. The production for 1922 was ap proximately 49,000,000 pounds for 1923 44,000,000 pounds for 1924 43.000,000 pounds and for 1925 41,000,000 pounds. It is, of course, recognized that weath er conditions had more to do with this decreased production than any other one factor, but there is reason to believe that a cooperative association con trolling a sufficient quantity of the product can gradually con trol production through grad ually lowering prices when pro duction is too high, and grad- uolly increasing prices when production is too low. It may be said that this is just what happens under the auction sys tem, but the objection to this system is that the price fluctua tions are too violent. For in stance, under the auction system a 36,000,000 pound crop of Vir ginia dark fired tobacco in, 1919 sold on the auction floor for an average price of nearly 25c per pound, while the 4, 000,000 pound crop produced in 1920 brought only about 9c per pound, and the 49,000,000 pound cropldence. produced in 1922 brought nearly 20c per pound. There can be no permanent prosperity among farmers as long as we have such violent fluctuations in prices from year to year. In view of these facts, it would seem that cooperation still has much to offer to the tobacco growers and other business men of the Virginia dark fired belt If this much could be accom plished when our farmers know practically nothing about coop erative marketing, is it no logi cal to expect that more can be accomplished during the next five years with our farmers hav ing learned much by practical experience concerning both the limitations and possibilities of cooperation?

Some of these are still there. At the time of the War Between the States, Capt. William Mathews, a veteran of the War of 1812, own ed the farm surrounding the church. When General U. S. Grant and his army passed through the farm, Capt. Mathews, to retard Grants progress to Appomattox, invited him to spend the night in the Mathews home. General Grant declined, and Capt. Mathews replied, You will come back from Appomattox faster than you went up there. The next day, Gen. Grant stopped along the same red clay road, and told Capt. Mathews that he knew Lee was going to surrender when he went up there. The little church, with a plank nailed down the middle to separate the ladies from ths gentleman, was near the road, but the Northern soldiers did it no harm.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Riggin, State Health Commissioner, declared the most constructive step would be to provide county health units in the 52 counties not now rendering this essential function. Dr. Douglas S. Freeman, State Council chairman, emphasized that America is the only ?.ee _ nation able to furnish arms to resist world agressors. Defense activities at this stag would be diverted, General Ander son said, by building air-raid shel ters and evolving civilian evacua tio nplans. Immediate problems, he said, concern access highways, housing, machine tool inventories, public health a!t concentration points and soidier-sailor recreation.

Hudgins, Appomattox Coun ty Agent since the spring of 1926, will retire March 31, according to announcement made this week. The veteran agricultural leader will be succeeded here by James A. Smith, a native of South Carolina and a graduate of Clemson College. Mr. Smith, 29, is at present assistant agent in Halifax County. He is a veteran of World War II, and dur ing his work with the Extension Service has won recognition for his activities with 4-H Clubs, as well as general assistance to farmers. The retirement of Mr. Hudgins will be made the occasion for a testimonial banquet, scheduled for Thursday night, March 10. Leaders of the V. f. I. Extension Service will join with local farmers and business men in honoring Mr. Hud gins. The banquet, scheduled for the school cafeteria, will include among its distinguished guests Dr. John R. Hutcheson, of V. P. I., and Judge Edwin W. Hudgins, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia. He is a brother of R. B. Hudgins. The banquet is being arranged by the County Agricultural Board. Rueben Boatwright Hudgins is a native of New Canton, Bucking ham County. He attended Fork Un ion Military Academy and attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute. He served with the old Tri-State Tobacco Growers Association from 1922 until 1926. He is a Mason, a member of Liberty Baptist Church, and has received many honors dur ing his career in Extension work. Extension work began in Appo mattox in 1911. Major J. W. Flood was the first county agent and served from 1911 to 1913. Major Flood used horseback and a buggy to cover the county preaching the theory that a program and lime apd legumes would increase yields and make profits for farmers. His per sonality was an inspiration to farm ers and Major Flood declared that we could produce more corn and other crops on farmland by using smart methods.  In 1914, Bernard G. Anderson became the Appomattox County A- gent. He was the first agent ap pointed under the Smith-Lever Act. He was a 1906 graduate at V. P. I., and had served as assistant at the V. P. I. Experiment Station under E. H. Mathinson. He served as the county agent here until 1918, and is affectionately respected by every citizen of the county for his long career in farm, school and church activities. Mr. Anderson is now re tired and resides at his home here. W. H. Byrne succedded Anderson as county agent, iq 1918. He serv ed for even years. He was not above taking the handles of a plow to show farmers how to use the ridge system of cultivating tobacco and corn. He worked day and night showing farmers how to mix fertili zers, and better their ways of do ing things.. And then from his of fice he directed a variety of activi ties, such as 4-H Clubs. All the while he preached the worthwhile ness of Extension Service to farm ers. His efforts attracted wide at tention and he moved up in promo tion in 1926.
