They were going to W est Virginia, but, it is alleged, C arter drank heavily and went ino the room s over a saloon occupied by. Fannie H odges and her son. H e claimed to be a Secret Service agent of the Governm ent, it is said, and un dertook to dislodge the tenants. W il liam M artin grappled with hint in his attempt to shoot young Hodges, but . failed in his effort. The bullet entered the left side of tire neck and evidently lodged about the spinal cord.

Ernbrey for 16 years, and was displaced. In turning over the farm property Baker claimed a certain cow as thc property of his wife. M ajor Embrcy was confident thc cow belong ed to him. The case first came up in a m agistrates court, and was removed to thc County C ourt of Stafford, where four lawyers took part in the proceed ings before Judge Chichester. .The case went against Baker, and wasap pealed, and will b e . carried to the cir cuit Court.

All the parties con cerned are prom inent residents of the county. Some sensational evidence was introduced during the trial. G eorge Christian, colored, was elec trocuted at N ew port News by coming in contact with a live wire. H e caught hold of the wire leading to a 16 -candle- power light at a point where the insu lation was worn off. It is thought the feed wire m ust have been crossed witlj a street wire, as death was instantane ous and there was current enough to burn off three fingers. The barn of J. A.

The evidence showed that i ins- ley was in the crowd that beat the sail ors. The fact that several German coins lost by one of the sailors were found in his pockets convicted him. Thc Jamestown Exposition advocates in thc House have thc whip-hand, and succeeded in defeating the bill to appro priate an additional  100,000 for the im provement and enlargement of the Capi tol.

Our special Washington cor respondent says of him The death of Flood is directly due to his fine devotion to his State and partv When tbs Republicans gave it out that they were going to break into the solid South and that Vir ginia was to be the gateway, everyone knew that it meant another loosening of the strings of the long purse that poured out millions and millions for the election of Harrison, Me Kinley, Roosevelt, Taft and Hardingthe long purse of privilege. The Virginia leaders looked over the field and could see no one but Flood to lea the fight to prevent the Repub licans again getting a foothold in the State that was still re- membring painfully the days of the carpet baggers So Flood wae drafted for the iob, though already Chairman of the Demo cratic Congressional Commit tee, he went into it like he went into every other fight with every ounce of force there was in him Of course he wod , aud the Democrats carried Vir ginia by the biggest majority ever known, but Flood came back to Washington and took to hi bed, never to leave it. Of him it can be truly said  He died with the harness on, the broad sword leaping, the wild fight surging fast  Rich as the party is in leadership, Democracy can ill spare him, this proud Virginian, proud of his clean hands, his clean pub tic record, Lis clean profession al career and his spotless personal character. It is re membered of bim that when he first came t j Congress, defeat ing Jacob Yost, a Republican, the result was very close ano he was offered the certificate of election on. a technicality, wbereu ton be refused to accept it, preferring to stand aside until the status of every ques cioned ba lot wae determined, be knew he might lose by so doing, but be preferred it that way. The folio wiug tribute paid our distinguished countyman by a life-long friend is worthy of both men Nobody seems to be able to realize chat Hal Flood, of Ap pomattox, is dead. We cannot grasp the fact that the mao of vigor and force and activity upon wuern we Had learned to rely, and under whose devoted watch care we had learned to feel secure has been suddenly called from his earthly duties, ank that our friend is no more. Mr. Floods great abilities and worth in public life were uaiversaly recognized. But to the people of Appomattox nr was held in esteem as nowhere else, because it was here that tiis worth in private life was best known.

She has made repairs, to the residence, -but it is understood that she now declines to take the property. Mr. Gray has entered suit here for 10,000 damages and has levied on valuable furniture Mrs. Nor ton has stored. In the Circuit Court of Charles County Judge Thomas W. Harrison sentenced Joseph H. Copenhaver for 12 years in the Virginia Penitentiary. Copenhavers attornies, Marshall Mc Cormick and Blackburn Smith, se cured a stay of sentence for 90 days and will take the case to the State Supreme Court. Copenhaver shot and killed his wife last April while on a spree.  He had been confined in the  insane asylum at Staunton on several occasions.  J. Lewis Evans, one of the oldest locomotive engineers in the world, died in Lynchburg, in the seventy- ninth year of his age. He had been in the employ of the Southern and the older companies for over half a cen tury, and for 40 years was engineer on passenger trains, having operated the first train on the old Grange and Al exandria Railroad. He had lived in Lynchburg about 40 years, but during the past year had been very feeble. Mrs. Catherine A. Brady, widow of the late John L. Brady, of Scotttsville, Albemarle county, died at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Robert A. Sanders, at New Baltimore in her ninety-first year. As the result of a row at Buena Vista, Stuart Farrow, a resident of thatt city, had his legs cut off by a freight train, and Edward Tinsley is now confined in the jail at Lexington for shooting Robert White. The lat ter are negroes and quarreled ovet liquor. Farrow was watching the fight and did not notice the approach of the train. He is not expected to live. Mrs. Jane B. Meade, widow of Rich ard Kidder Meade, died .t her home, hear White Post, Clarke county, aged 86 years. She was a daughter o Benjamin Grymes, of Somerset, King George county. A large mortgage is now being spread upon the records of the Cir cuit Court of Warren County. II is  deed of trust by the Norfolk and Western Railroad Company to se cure the sum of 35,000,000. The in strument, which is in book form, bears the date of July 1, 1904, and contains 79 pages of closely printed matter. The State tax amounts to 20,964, and the document has to be recorded in every county through which this railway passes. The trustee is the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. The attempt to wreck a freight tram on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway near Lynchburg evidently wai planned by four men whose purpose was robbery. One of the men was on the train when it struck the obstruc tion,. and when it stopped he began throwing mOrohandise from, a car. The attempt to loot the train, how ever, was unsuccessful. Roy Christie, 14 years old, of New port News, was thrown from a bicy cle and had his skull fractured from ear to ear. He was removed to the hospital and an operation was per formed, but the physicians entertfiin little hope for his recovery. The boy was speeding along the street on his way from school, when his wheel struck a rock. In the Police Court, at Lynchburg Mayor Smith acquitted E. E. Lips comb, an expressman, of the charge of feloniously shooting Pullman Con ductor Charles L. Harrison in that city two weeks ago, the evidence showing that the shooting was ar accident. A fine 25 was imposed on Lipscomb form criminal carelessness in handling a loaded weapon. The case will be appealed. The-Lynchburg City Council adopt ed a resolution in joint session author izing the City Attorney to take steps to stop the pollution of the James river by pulp mills. It is believed thal this is the beginning of a big fight to be made against pulp mill owners in the vicinity of Covington. Recent ly the water has become black.
