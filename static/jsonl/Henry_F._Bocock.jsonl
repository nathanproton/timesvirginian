The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

At a largely attended mass-meet ing B. F. Nuckola was nmde chair man and _ P. Grigg, secretary. Fhe object of the meeting was the adoption of the resolutions printed below, bidding fuiewdl to tbe old County Court system, and the strong ndorsement of Judve Moss, as a Tair and impartial judge, who has -irerided over the court for the past twelve .rars. Col. Kobt. T. Hub bard. Hon. E. W. Hubbard, A. P. Grigg and others spoke feelingly to the resolution and Judge A. 8. Hall, while not opposing the resolution, -aid he was glad the constitution bad abolished the Conntv Court -ysteni. The resolution was adopt ed, and the Messrs. Hubbard and Col. James Lyons were appointed a committee to inform Judge Moss of I - he action of the meeting, and the Judge came forwa-d and in a few well chosen remarks thanked the bar and the meeting for the expres sions of confidence and esteemed the resolutions contained. Whereas our English ancestors rod their decendants in America have for nearly a thousand years had i court of tbe shire, or county court for hearing and determining the minor controversies of the people, a court especially intended for the masses of small means to save them from journeys and heavy expense, nd whereas such local tribunal is t great convenience to them and either it or some substitute will be necessary for letting to bail, ap pointment of guardians and person- 1 representatives, probate of wills tnd etc., therefore Resolved, by this mass-meeting  -f citizens of Buckingham county, held at this December connty court, 1903, that we regret the change in the, constitution abolishing this court. 2nd.  That in severing our rela tions with the incumbent, Judge John R. Moss, we bear cheerful testimony to tbe intelligence, integ rity, ability and dignity with which he has discharged the duties of County Judge, and in his retire ment will carry with him our best i wishes for bis wellfare. 3rd. That these proceedings be certified to the County Court with the request that they be entered on I the minutes of the Court. Jndge Moss will tender his resig nation as Connty Judge of Buck ingham as soon as the present term is adjourned, and will assume his duties in the Legislature the first of the year. Governor Montague! will be requested to appoint Jndge Crute, of Farmville, to hold the I January term. In the Court the only case of any importance was that of J. A. Le- Sneur  Bro., applicants for liquor license at lpha, which was opposed by a large petition to the Judge, ask ing that license be not granted. The Jndge continued the case, and ren dered an opinion, in which he said he had rather the new Court would pais upon the application for . li cense when there is objection. J. A. Trent ws granted  license to sell liquor near Arvonia, there being no opposition to him. Peter Coles, of Albemarle, and Mr. Addie Spencer were hunting at New Store last week. They were! the guests of Mr. L. D. Jones. Mr. J, W. Word has been ap- to the position of store keeper for the National Government at a salary of 2 per day.

Mr. William Spencer, is perhaps, the happiest travelling man who represents a Lynchburg house. He sold for the Quin-Marshall Co., in about eleven months time 100,000 in drygoods and notions. When this fact was reported to Mr. Spen cer, he promptly served notice ou his employers that he had a vaca tion due him.

It was given I me by a friend, who husband has a I brother living in Appomattox. They had written him sometime back and  asked him if he knew Judge Joel W.  Flood, who is a family connection of I mine. So he had sent them this clip ping from the paper of February I 25th. entitled, Father Darkleaf by c. h. r. I enjoyed it so very much, and thought I would write you and see if you might have some information from the early editions of your pa per, which might be of interest to me about the members of my fam ily who lived in Appomattox in the early days. My ancestors who lived there were Samuel Bocock, the home place was called, Wildway, which was half way between Bent Creek and Vera, Virginia, from material I have that my uncle, the late Charles Henry Buchanan, had sent my mother. He said that in 1934 it was owned by J. S. Kinney, Rt. 3, Appomattox, Va. Then I wondered if there was a Thomas family who lived there in those early days, whose daughter, Judith married Capt. John Bocock. This must have been around 17 hun dred and something. I cant put my hands on my data which has the dates on it, right now, anyway, the son of the above, John Thomas Bo cock married Mary Flood, and I be lieve the Flood family lived there also. One of the Floods married a Mary Fuqua, it was either John or Thomas. I have information which says one and then the other. I am most anxious to locate information on the Fuqua family, and to straight en out about which one of the Flood family is my ancestor. Judge Flood wrote me that it was John Flood II, and I feel sure he is correct. John Thomas Bocock and Mary Flood Bocock were the parents of my grandmother Mary Flood Bocock who married January 1, 1854 in Ap pomattox Appomattox Court House Virginia, John Rice Buchanan of Rockbridge County, Virginia. My mother, Mary Flood Buchanan was their daughter. I shall appreciate it very much if you could send me some material on these ancestors of mine. I know a great deal about the Bocock line, but you might have some material I do not have. If you do not have any records about them in your early file, you might be able to give me the name and address of some one who may be able to give me some. f Most sincerely, Frances Hall McCracken, note We will be glad to give the ftwuiwa y i iUvurttwKSii  any of our readers who may wish to write her regarding the above."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Bocock"], "snippet": "lived there were Samuel <mark>Bocock</mark>, the home place was"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Bocock"], "snippet": "lived there were Samuel <mark>Bocock</mark>, the home place was"}], "text_match": 1731669220158079097, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1116681273344", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1731669220158079097", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
