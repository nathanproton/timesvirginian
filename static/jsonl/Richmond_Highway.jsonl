Bowles, of Goochland, Baid sentiment in his section is now even more decidedly in favor of bonds than it was during the recent session of the Legislature. Delegate D. H. Pitt, of Albemarle, states that he saw no change of sentiment in his section for bonds, although he thought the people in the towns would favor them. He stated that he had not heard from any of the taxpayers of the country districts, but still thought them against a bond is sue. It was admitted on all sides, too, that the representatives of the Valley section are firm against bonds, this being the attitude taken in the last session, when they were denounced on the floor of the Senate for taking a dog in the manger stand. Among those who are advocating bonds is former Governor Henry C Stuart, who stated yesterday that the people of Clinch Valley section are strong for the speedy improvement of highways. Senators J. Belmont Wood- son, of Nelson, and G. W. Layman, of Craig, supporters of a bond issue, said that they see changes in favor of the bond in places formerly opposed. Among the other legislators at the roads session were Senators Saxon Holt, of Newport News C. OConor Goolrick, of Fredericksburg A. Wil lis Robertson, of Rockbridge, and Julien Gunn, of Henrico and Dele gates Norvell Henley, of Williams burg George Bowles, of Goochland, and Thomas C. Fletcher, of Henrico. The tentative allocations of funds by routes is as follows Route 1, 730,000 Route 2, 145,- 000 Route 3, 110,000 Route 4, 150,- 000 Route 5, 100,000 Route 6 , 180,- 000 Route 7, 190,000 Route 9, 530,- 000 Route 10, 560,000 Route 11, 490,000 Route 12, 330,000 Route 13, 225,000 Route 14, 280,000 Route 16, 60,000 Route 17, 255,000 Route 19, 50,000 Route 20, 50,000 Route 21, 50,000 Route 22, 100,000 Route 23, 50,000, and Camp No. 11, Culpep er, 50,000.  Route No. 1, includes Falmouth Bridge, 75,000 Fredericksburg, 225,- 000 Richmond-Petersburg, 200,000. On Route 9, 300,000 is allocated for the Lee Hall-Toano road on the Rich mond to Newport News Highway. On Route 13, 200,000 Is allocated for the Richmond-Tappahannock road, and on Route 19, 50,000 for the Richmond- Dixie Highway. Of the amount of funds available for new contracts for State highway construction, It must be remembered that the proceeds of the mill tax, which Is not collectible until Decem ber 20 , 1922, as well as the balance of the auto tax, all of which will not be collected until December 31, is In cluded. This fund cannot be antici pated further than three months ln advance, so that approximately 3,- 000,000 is all that can be let to con tract of State highway funds between now and fall. The variance between 4,750,000 arrived at from the figures of the State Auditor and the 5,315,000 amount of the allocations for new con tracts during the year, is due to dif ference in estimates of the receipts from auto tax and mill tax, between the auditor and the State Highway De partment. Allocations of 210,000 car ried over from 1921 have been also in eluded in the allocations of this year The use of even numbers in express ing the amount of money required to complete existing contracts would also tend to cause a slight difference in the figures of the two departments. It is only fair to explain that there must always be a balance to take care of uncompleted contracts as long as the State Highway Department is a going concern. The contracts are un der way and the money must be avail able to pay the contractors. The State Auditor has neglected to explain to the people that he, as the banker, holds the funds against which the operating department, which is the State Highway Com mission, makes contracts and incur obligations which are to ho paid by the State Auditor out of the funds to that particular account when set tlement is made.

Never again will Governor Mann announce that he has something to give away. Such a declaration, he is convinced, always produces a sur prising number of people willing to take it. In an unguarded moment a week or two ago, the Governor said there was at his disposal, in the treas ury of the nation in Washington, the sum of 10,000. It is Virginias part of an appropriation made by Congress last year for improvement of public highways over which mail is carried. In reality, it is generally regarded as the forerunner of national aid to good roads. Many roads in this State, it seems, are in need of improvement. Three, in especial, are being urged upon the Governor, for the money will te spent in accordance with his rec ommendation. One is the Richmond to Washington highway, about which so much has been written. Another is a road from Houston, Halifax coun ty, to Danville, strongly urged by Marshall B. Booker and others. The third is the Bristol to Roanoke High way, pushed by Congressman Slemp and leading citizens of the Southwest. The Bristol to Bluefield Highway, first recommended, seemB to have been abandoned for the Roanoke proposi tion. The old ante-bellum macadam ized road, some of it in bad repair, and with gaps between Seven Mile Ford and Bristol, could be completed, it is said, without great cost. Pro visos for use of the appropriation are that mail must be carried over the road and that at least 20,000 must be expended by the State and local ity in addition to the 10,000 given by Congress. The Governor has not determined upon his action."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Richmond", "highway"], "snippet": "ommendation.

When the State Highway Commis sion awarded road-building contracts entailing an expenditure of 447,000, as a result of bids opened on July 14, it was announced that all bids received indicated a very material decrease in construction costs, as well as a big saving in letting larger contracts.

The association says that the State of Michigan, and other States, because of the falling market, have asked for larger amounts for road construction this year and next.

The present plan is to establish a trust fund to furnish a monthly stipend for workers who have grown old in service of the company, by deducting from the econ omy dividend payable to workers each month a fraction of this earning. The textile company, which gets half of the economy dividend, will contribute a like amount to the sum. Newport News.

Fredericksburg.A horrible tragedy in which a loaded shotgun played a vi tal part and little John Rodey, the 8- year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. John Ro dey, was the victim, occurred here. While playing atr the home of Mr. and Mrs. W. C. Shelton, the gun went off and the full load of the 12-gauge sin gle-barrel shotgun entered the head of the little fellow, killing him instantly and scattering his brains along the wall and ceiling. The accident took place in the kitchen of the Shelton home, in which Mrs. Shelton was hold ing her baby while little John Rodey, who lived next door, was playing with Sissy and LeRoy Shelton, both near his age. Alvin, another child about 11 years old, was also in the room, but was leaning out of the window, and does not know how the accident oc curred. When the gun exploded, Mrs. Shelton screamed, and at the sight of the lifeless body in a pool of blood, she fainted. Neighbors hearing the shot and the screams of the frightened children, rushed into the house and found Mrs. Shelton unconscious and the children terrified. It appears that the loaded gun was usually kept In a corner behind the kitchen door, and the little tots took it up. It is be lieved little John Rodey was holding the gun with the butt resting on the floor. Petersburg.  Philip A.

Richmond  No Federal aid for 1922 for State highway construction in Virginia or any other State is the serious pros pect which is facing road builders in this State, according to officials of the Virginia Good Roads Association, who have been keeping in close touch with road legislation now before Congress. How serious this would be to Vir ginia may be gathered from the fact that the hertofore expected aid from the Federal Government, amounting to  2 , 000 , 000 , which is the amount Virginia received this year, represents two-fifths of the total amount avail able for new construction of State highways in Virginia, provided the General Assembly only continued the present source of revenue. The State funds for new construc tion on the present financial basis for 1922 will amount to only 3,300,000, including the valuation of convict la bor. In the face of a big reduction in the price of labor and materials for road construction, Virginia will have only about one-half of the limited funds available for this year, and less than one-third of the amount which West Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina already have made available for road construction for 1922, unless Congress can be persuaded to continue Federal aid and the General Assembly can materially increase the amount oi road funds available for new construc tion of State highways. That the fears of the good roads advocates as to the failure of Con gress to grant Federal aid are well grounded, requiring the active work through their Congressmen and Sena tors on the part of every person in terested in the cause, is evidenced by the apparently irreconcilable differ ences between the Senate and the House as to the form of administration of Federal aid. The Senate is insist ing on the Townsend hill, which pro vides for a commission of three, whilt the House is usually insistent on the Dowell bill, which provides in the main for the continuation of the office oi public roads of the United States De partment of Agriculture. The Townsend hill is also insisteni on the expenditure of Federal aid on  highways of interstate importance The difference between the twe houses of Congress is being main tained as far as possible by three groups in both houses. One of these groups is composed of Senators and Representatives from the thickly pop ulated States, such as New York and Pennsylvania, who are opposed to Federal aid of any kind on the grounds that their constituents pay the larger proportion of the taxes used to build highways in the South and other sections. Another group which takes in the majority of the supporters of the Townsend hill asserts that Federal aid in the past has been wasted, as far as the Federal Government is con cerned, in being expended on short stretches of State highways, which be gin nowhere and end nowhere. Unless a bill can be passed which will insure the expenditure of Federal funds on highways of interstate importance they are opposed to Federal aid of any kind Still another group, taking the fig ures of the Secretary of Agriculture  only as to the amount of Federal aid  which has not been actually checked  out, assert that there is a big sum of Federal aid previously granted which has not been expended, and that ! the States can be given a year or two to take up the funds. This group has in mind that failure on the part of this Congress to appropriate 100.000,009 I annually for Federal aid will help to j keep down the total amount of Federal  appropriations."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Richmond", "highway"], "snippet": "For Roads In 1922. <mark>Richmond</mark>  No Federal aid for 1922 for State <mark>highway</mark> construction in Virginia or"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Richmond", "highway"], "snippet": "For Roads In 1922. <mark>Richmond</mark>  No Federal aid for 1922 for State <mark>highway</mark> construction in Virginia or"}], "text_match": 1157451470501576825, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2211897409536", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1157451470501576825", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
