Mrs. Raynor nodded, and pointed contemptuously at her servant.  This fellow claims to have some thing to communicate that deeply con cerns you. Let him speak, then, lifting his handsome shoulders with an express ive shrug. What I have to say can be told in a very few words, said John.  Yonder adventurer cannot be Paul Raynor for the very good reason that I am ho!  You! gasped Mrs. Raynor, trem bling with excitement.  What mad ness is this? You are beside yourself!  Nay, said John.  I am the true heir of Summernook. It was a whim of mine to come here and hire out as a servantl wished to study you before declaring myself, and if you were found worthy, leave you lu undis turbed possession of the estate. This seems incredible!  Decidedly so, sneered Paul. The fellows insolence and assurance are extraordinary. But I have no desire to enter upon a long discussion. Here are two certificatesone the marriage of my parents, the other of my birth and baptism. Pray examine them you will find that they are duly attest ed. Mrs. Raynor took the papers lie of fered and hurriedly glanced at them. They were all they claimed to be. As Johns gaze fell upon them a look of surprise and terror swept over his face. He staggered backward as though some one had dealt him a dead ly blow.  Good God! be gasped.  1 have been robbed.  Robbed? echoed his mistress. These papers are minethe proofs of my identityI had them last night they were stolen from my room while l slept. Ob, madam, for Gods sake, dont suffet yourself to be misled by the villains cunning! Mrs. Raynor turned haughtily away. This artifice Is too shallow. You cannot expect me to credit a story so improbable. I am tired of the scene. You will be good enough to withdraw.  I swear ----   Not another word, she angrily in terrupted.  Go! He could do 110 less than obey. As lie went out with slow, reluctant steps be had the misery of seeing his rival clasp Mrs. Rhynors hand and raise it to his lips. Two days went by. John had been dismissed from the service of Ills mis tress, but he still lingered about tlie premises. He was nearly crazed with the dread that the woman lie loved might fail a victim to the adventurer who sought her favor, in spite of his efforts to save her. riiuling her alone on the terrace in the late twilight, he impulsively flung himself at her feet.  Listen to mo, dariing, he cried. You mustyou shall! I would gladly give my life for you. For weeks, now, 1 have lived only in the light of your smile. Waithe patient. I cant see you sacrifice yourself. Only give me time to bring forward those who can attest the truth of the strange story I have told. His passion and despair moved the woman more than she was willing to acknowledge.  Hush! she cried, trying in vain to calm herself. Stand out of my way How dare you ever speak to me after what lias passed? She hurried into the house, pretend ing to be very angry at his presump tion. But her heart beat fast, and 1 was with difficulty that she kept back the scalding tears that rose to hei eyes. An hour later, in tlie brilliantly-light ed drawing-room, other bearded lips were pouring their tale into her ear.  I have learned to love you passion ately already. the so-called Paul Ray nor said.

I have a list of some 40 or 50 tracts, names of buyers, and the amount sold for. ou get even with Mr. Thomhili by making him enquire into this when he gets to Rich mono. There was, undoubtedly, such a sale of delinquent lands in Novem ber or December, 1873. This was rather more than ten years before Auditor Marye went into office, and more than twelve years oe.fore the second sales, made iu 1886. May peace on earth and good will to man be our motto now and ever more.

All you need do is keep steerage way, and whit until you are picked up. You dont Imngine we want you sailing into the harbor at St. Johns the same time we get there, do you? Come on now stop this talk, and give us an answer. For a long moment I stood motion less, staring out through the open port at the sunlit waters. It seemed to me my best course was to at least pretend to yield to their wishes. To acquiesce would Insure me a measure of free dom on board, an opportunity to learn the exact conditions, and might enable me to save the ship from destruction. As to McCann, he had some object in all this far more important than ap peared on the surface. He was never assuming this risk, or investing all tills money In an illegal cause, without a more serious purpose than an idle desire to return to New York. He was taking a tremendous chance, driv en by some impulse I could not com prehend. What was the secrethate, revenge, greed, love? I would find out sometime bnt now I could only grope In the dark, guessing at his mo tives. Yet I kqew thishis promises were lies. He would make use of me he would Induce me to pilot the ship to the spot he desired to attain on the broad bosom of the ocean, and then what? The man would never be fool enough to permit the Indian Chief to sail into any harbor to accuse him of such a crime. Back of all his words, his explanations, his apparent fair ness, lurked treachery. I felt it, and knew it, and the very suspicion led me to reach swift decision. My eyes met his with a smile. I cannot conceive that I have much choice I said quietly. It Is to either do this In freedom, or under compul slon. Naturally I prefer the former. You mean you accept our offer? YesL-I will figure out the proper course, and report to you when the ves sel Is at the place you designate. Tht Is all that is asked of me. In return -I have your pledge that the ship will be left in good condition, with all who are loyal safe on board? Yes. There Is one more condition, Mc Cann. What? That Miss Carrington be left abso lutely unmolested by either you or your men, until the time comes or you to take to the boats. Hah! So that Is really where the shoe pinches! We will not quarrel about Iteither say yes or no. What do you mean by unmolested? Am I prohibited from speaiking to the lady? That Is to be left to her choice, not yours. She Is to retain the key to her stateroom to eat alone If she prefers, and to see such associates aboard as she teslres. Liverpool laughed drunkenly. That aint the argyment, he said easily. So far as I see, that dont change things none. Shes locked her self In anyhow, an wont answer no body. McCann growled something which I took to be assent, and I was myself so anxious to ascertain our exact posi tion as to have no desire for further argument. I could be of no possible value locked a prisoner In that state room  no protection to her. Indeed, if I refused to navigate the vessel, leav ing the ship to drift blindly through these unknown waters, exposed con stantly to peril, I would be guilty of a failure to do my duty almost as great as the crime of these others. On deck, knowing where we were and the ! direction in which we were going, the opportunity might arise for the accom plishment of much. I grasped the nec essary Instruments from the swinging shelf, and, with these in my hands turned toward the door. Come on, then, I said, Ignoring the fact that I was any longer a prisoner. Bring the chart, one of you, and Ill point out where we are to you on deck. Just hold on a minute, and Liver pool, blocking the doorway, pushed me back with his huge hand. Were the bosses, not you. Glt It out o your head right now. mister, that yer the captain of this ship Indian Chief. Blast yer ye aint nuthln an If yer attempt to play jis any dirty tricks. Ill smash yer the same as I would a fly. Ain that right, Mr. McCann? Oh, Hollis understands, Red. He knows weve gone too far In this game to take any chances. Let him pass. Well, growled the giant, stepping aside, I just wanted him ter know, dont kill nobody in cold blood but In goln ter take keer of myself an my mates. Yer glt me, skipper? Yes, I get you, I answered a bit wearily. So let it go at that, my man I know the time to fight, and the time to keep quiet.

Three warships will,soon be frowning on Monte Cristi, the most revolutionary port in Santo Domingo. The cruisers Detroit and Yankee, the latter with 200 marines, are already there, and the Newark has sailed from Guantanamo for that port. If the revolutionists reported as landing there two days ago make any dis turbances they are sure to feel the heavy hand of the American naval force. There is no secret of the Administra tions attitude that a revolution against Morales now is a revolution against the United States. Minister Dawson reports that the rea son for unrest which is favorable to revolutionary propagandas is that the Dominicans have heard that the United States Senate entirely rejecter the fiscal protectorate pratocol. Minister Dawson, President Morales and the American officers are doing their best to make the people all over the little republic aware of the new arrangement. The two men named by the United States to administer the customs of San to Domingo are Dr. W. E. Gould, of Baltimore, and Col. G. R. Colton, of Nebraska, who is Collector of Customs at Iloilo, P. I. Dr. Gould was suggested by Prof. J. H. Hollander, of Johns Hop kins University, Baltimore, who is to make a report to President Roosevelt on conditions in Santo Domingo. Consultations are being held daily be tween the President and Secretary of War Taft regarding the agreement be tween this country and Santo Domingo. The President belives, and has so ex pressed himself to many callers at the White House, that he has acted well within his executive power in conclud ing such an agreement with Santo Do mingo. He believes that his attitude and actions will receive the support of the Senate. He also is now firmly con vinced that, when the Senate convenes in extraordinary session next fall, the Santo Domingo  .city will be ratified. Both the President and Secretary Taft are inclined to question the right, of the Santo Domingo Improvement Company to receive the full amount of the 40,- 000 a mpnth from the customs receipts of the ports set apart for them under the arbitral agreement of last year. Pro fessor Hollander goes to Santo Domingo for the distinct purpose of investigating the claims of this company and also to examine carefully the fiscal affairs and prospects of the republic. His mission, it is explained at the W ar and State Departments, is radically different from that of Dr. Gould and Colonel Colton, who have been appointed to collect cus toms dues at Santo Domingo ports. Dr. Hollander is the agent of the United States Government and will report in detail the exact situation in the island. The Italian Ambassador, Signor May or des Planches, was an early caller at the State Department for the purpose of ascertaining definitely the arrangements recently reached by United States Minis ter Dawson, at Santo Domingo, for the administration of customs of the island. After the matter had been explained to him by Acting Secretary of State Adee Ambassador Planches was satisfied and said he would advise his Government to agree to the proposition and await the action of the United States Senate on the treaty next session.

The first step toward accepting Mr. Andrew Carnegies offer of 10,000,000 to the United States Government as an endow ment fund for the promotion of higher education was token here, when articles were filed with the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia for the Car negie Institution. The incorporators are John Hay, Secretory of State, Edward D. White, Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Daniel Coit Gilman, late President of the Johns Hopkins University. Charles D. Walcott, superintendent of the Geological Survey. John S. Billings, ex-Surgeon-General of the Navy. Carroll D. Wright, Commissioner of Labor. The articles fix the name and title of the institution as the Carnegie Institu tion and show that it is organized  for a perpetual term. Its objects are the promotion of study and research, the power to acquire, hold and convey real estate and other property, and to estab lish general and special funds to as sist investigations in science, literature or art to co-operate with governments, universities, colleges, technical schools, learned societies and individuals to ap point committees of experts to direct special lines of research, publish and distribute documents, conduct lectures and hold meetings, acquire and maintain a library, and in general to do and per form all things necessary to promote the objects of said institution. The affairs, funds and property of the corporation will be in general charge of a board of trustees, to consist during the first year of 27, and thereafter not to exceed 30 members, except by a three- quarter vote of the board. . The filing of the papers followed a meeting in the offee of Secretary Hay, which was attended by all of the incor porators and Mr. Baker. It is assumed that from the legal action thus taken, Mr. Carnegie has removed the cause of the objection raised to the securities in which the 10,000.000 endowment was to be made on December 10, it being said that United States Steel Corpora tion bonds were the collateral. It was said that such securities in the posses sion of the United States, the income of which was used for the- promotion of education, might seriously embarrass the Department of Justice in the event of legal action being taken against combi nations or trusts. So Mr. Carnegie was informed their acceptance was impossi ble.  A few days later, Mr. Carnegie ap peared at the White House and dined with the President, after which it was announced Mr. Carnegie had decided to remove all grounds for objection. About the same tinie a sale of Steel Corpora tion securities amounting to about n,- 000,000 was reported in New York, and announced Mr. Carnegie had decided to this, in conection with Mr. Carnegies proposed donor was-the seller.

Payne, Postmaster-General of the United States, a member of the National Republican Commit- I tee, a stalwart of his party, with the ! history of which, both in his home. State and nationality, he has been identified for many years, died at his apartments at the Arlington Hotel at 610 oclock Tuesday night, aged 60 I years. His death and its cause were announced in the following official bulletin issued by the attending phy sicians The postmaster-Gencral died at 610 P. M. He died peacefully with out a struggle. Cause of death, dis ease of mitral valve and dilation of th_ heart. P. M. RIXEY. G. LLO YD MAGRUDER. C. T. GRAYSON. Mr. Payne had been in pcor health for at least two years, but his last illness covered only seven days, an attack of heart trouble last week pre cipitating the end at a time when after a rest he seemed to have re- ! covered a small measure of his vital ity, impaired by years of arduous, la- 1 bor. Death came after nearly six I hours of unconsciousness. I The last official caller to inquire as to Mr. Paynes condition was Presi- ccnt Roosevelt, and he had been gone only about 10 minutes when the strick en member of the Cabinet expired, j secretary Hay had called at the Payne ! apartments a few -linutcs before the President made his visit. Neither j entered the sick room. As Mr. i Roosevelt was leaving, - about 6 i odock, he spoke feelingly of Mr. I Fayne to the newspaper men gath- I ered in front of the hotel as the I sweetest, most lovable and trustful  man I ever knew. The last day had been one during which practically all hope had been abandoned for sorne hours. The ap- I proach of dissolution began during j the noon hour, when the sick man  lost consciousness and no longer ree- 1 ognized those whom he had attempted  to cheer during his illness by saying 1 to them that he was all right. When  Mrs. Payne saw that the end was ! near she summoned Rev. Dr. Dunlap, i and at her request he read at the bed- i side of the dying man Psalm exxx,  Out of the Depths, and then re-  peated the prayers the Episcopal I Church provides shall be read at the- ! bed of those about to pass away. Funeral services will be held at St. I Johns Episcopal Church in this city I Friday morning, and at 315 in the afternoon the body will be taken to the Pennsylvania Railroad Station and placed aboard the private car of Presi dent A. J. Earling, of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Pa il Railroad, who j tendered the use of the car by tele- ! graph. The body should arrive at Milwaukee Saturday evening, and services will be held next Sunday evening at All Saints Episcopal Church there. A message has been sent to Rt. Rev. Isaac L. Nicholson, the Bishop of Milwaukee, who is now I at a convention in Boston, asking him j if he can officiate. L.terinent will be at the Forest Home Cemetery, Mil waukee.

I wouldnt advise you to try that, he sneered, for there Is crew enough on deck to man-handle you to a finish. You can go In quietly, or Ill call them down, and have you thrown In.  So take your choice. I looked at the two of them, eager enough myself to make It a fight. Yet what was the use? Any excuse en abling him to confine me more closely would evidently be to his advantage. I conquered myself, and hands clinched, crossed the deck space, and entered my stateroom, dosing the door. I heard McCann laugh, and say some thing to Simms then I knew he crossed the cabin, nnd went up the stairs.. To better control myself I thrust my face out through the open port, breathing In tlse salty freshness of the air. Suddenly I became aware that others had entered the-main cabin. There was no sound of voices nothing to tell me the purpose of this Invasion, yet I felt certain that, at least, a dozen men had descended the steps from the compan ion. I stood erect listening there was fumbling at my door! Had McCann changed his mind? Were they about to attack me In force? Revolver in hand took a step forward, half-ready to welcome any open hostility, The first sea rat to open that door, called, will get whats coming to him.

This time 1 was a prisoner beyond donbt they had left me no loophole of escape. But why? What had I done to warrant them in breaking their pledge? Could It be that McCann had no further use for me? no desire for another observa tion? If this wa true, then It must be the men proposed deserting the ship that very night, and taking a chance at getting ashore in one of those northern bays. And they had nailed me In to die like a rat In this hole, when the Indian Chief went down. For the Instant, as this fear gripped me, I was dazed and incapable of thought helpless to even clearly com prehend the full horror, I do not be lieve It was my own situation which so completely unmanned me, but the remembrance of Vera. What would become of her? She would be alone In McCanns power without a human be ing to whom she could appeal. She would be forced Into the boat despite her struggles, laughed at, and mocked. She might even be compelled to wit- ness the slow staking of the ship carry lng us down Into the depths. And then what? The vision I conjured up was agony, and I sank back upon the stool, my face buried in my hands. It is not even yet clear in my mind how the remaining hours of that after noon passed. I was conscious only of a mad, Impotent rage. Wild schemes flashed through my brain, only to fall 6f execution.

In this sermon he ar gues, contrary to the opinion of many, that religion is an active principle which works constantly for the welfare of body end mind and soul. His text is Luke xiv, 84, Salt is good. The Bible is a dictionary of the finest similes. It employs among living creat ures storks and eagles and doves and uni corns and sheep and cattle among trees, sycamores and terebinths amd pomegran ates and almonds and apples among jew els, pearls and amethysts and jacinths and chrysoprases. Christ uses no stale illustrations. The lilies that He plucks in His discourse are dewy fresh the ravens in His discourses are not stuffed specimens of birds, hut warm with life from wing tip to wing tip the fish He points to are not dull about the gills, as though long cap tured. but a-squirm in the wet net just brought up on the beach of Tiberias. In my text, which is the peroration of one of His sermons, He picks up a crystal and holds it before His congregation as an illus tration of divine grace in the heart when He says what wc all know by experiment, Salt is good. I shall try to carry out the Saviours idea in this text and in the first place say to you that grace is like salt in its beauty. In Gallicia there are mines of salt with ex cavations and underground passages reach ing, I am told, 280 miles. Far underground there are chapels and halls of reception, the columns, the altars and the pulpits of salt. W hen the king and the princes come to visit these mines, the whole place is illuminated, ami the glory of crystal walls and crystal ceilings and crystal floors and crystal columns, under lie glare of the torches and the lamps, needs words of crys tal to describe it. But you need not go so far as that to find the beauty of salt. You live in a land which produces millions of bushels of it in a year, and you can take the moruing rail train and in a few hours get to the salt mines and salt springs, and you have this article morning, noon and night on your table. Salt lias all the beauty of the snowflake and water foam, with durability added. It is beautiful to the naked eye, but under the glass you see the stars, and the diamonds, and the white trie branches, and the splinters, and the bridges of fire as the sun glints them. There is more architectural skill in one of these crystals of salt than human inge nuity has ever demonstrated in an Alham bra or St. Peters. It would take all time, with an infringe ment upon eternity, for an angel of God to tell one-half the glories in a salt crystal. So with the grace of God it is perfectly beautiful. I have seen it smooth out wrin kles of care from the brow I have seen it make an aged man feel almost young again I have seen it lift the stooping shoulders and put sparkle into the dull eye. Solomon discovered its therapeutic quali ties when he said. It is marrow to the hones. It helps to digest the food and to purify the blood and to calm the pulses and quiet the spleen, and instead of Tyn dalls prayer test of twenty years ago, put ting a man in a philosophical hospital to be experimented upon by prayer, it keeps him go well that he does not need to be prayed for as an invalid. I am sneaking now of a healthy religionnot of that morbid relig- iop that sits for three hours on a grave stone reading Herveys Meditations Among the Tombsa religion that pros pers best in a bad state of the liver! I speak of the religion that Christ preached. I suppose, when that religion has con quered the world, that disease will be ban ished, and that a man 100 years of age will come in from business and say, I am tired I think it must be time for me to go. and without one physical pang heaven will have him. But the chief beauty of grace is in the soul. It takes that which was hard and cold and repulsive and makes it all over again. It pours upon ones nature what David calls the beauty of holiness. It extirpates everything that is hateful and unclean. If jealousy and pride and lust and worldliness lurk about, they are cliaiued and have a very small sweep, Jesus throws upon the soul the fragrance of a summer garden as He comes in say ing, I am the Rose of Sharon, and He submerges it with the glory of a spring morning, as He Says, I am the light. Oh, how much that grace did for the three Johns! It took John Bunyan, the foul mouthed, and made him John Bun. van, the immortal dreamer it took John Newton, the infidel sailor, and in the midst of the hurricane made him cry out, My mothers God, have mercy upon me! It took John Summerfield from a life of sin and by the hand of a Christian maker of edge tools led him into the pulpit _ that butns still with the light of that Christian eloquence which charmed thousands te the Jesus whom He once despised. Ab, you may search all the earth over for anything so beautiful or beautifying as the grace of God! Go all through the deep mine pas sages of Wieliczka and amid the under ground kingdoms of salt in Hallstadt and how me anything so transcendently beau tiful as this grace of God fashioned and hung in eternal crystals. Again, grace is like salt in the fact that it is a necessity of life. Man and beast perish without salt. What are those paths across the western prairie? Why, they were made there by deer and buffalo going to and coming away from the salt licks. Chemists and physicians all the world over tell us that salt is a necessity of life. And so with the grace of God you must have it or die. I know a great many speak of it as a mere adornment, asort of shoulder strap adorning a soldier, or a light, froth ing dessert brought in after the greatest part of the banquet of life is over, or a medicine to be taken after powders and mustard plasters have failed to do their work, but ordinarily a mere superfluity, a string of bells around a horses neck while he draws the load and in nowise helping him to draw it. So far from that I declare the grace of God to be the first and the last necessity. It is food we must take or starve Into an eternity of famine. It is clothing, without which wo freeze to the mast of infinite terror. It is the plank, and the only plank, on which we can float shoreward. It is the ladder, and the only ladder, on which we can climb up into the light. It ij a postive necessity for the soul. You can tell very easily what the effect would be if a person refused to take salt into the body. The energies would fail, the lungs would struggle with the air, slow fevers would crawl through the brain, the heart would flutter, and tne life would be gone. Salt, a necessity for the life of the body the grace of God, a necessity for the life of the soul! Again, I remark that grace is like salt in abundance. God has strewn salt in vast profusion all over the continents. Russia seems built on a salt-cellar. There is one region in that country that turns out 90,000 tons of salt in a year. England and Russia and Italy have inexhaustible resources in this respect. Norway and Sweden, white with snow abdve, white with salt beneath. Austria, yielding 900,000 tons annually. Nearly all the nations rich in itrock salt, spring salt, sea salt. Christ, the Creator of the world, when He uttered our text, knew it would become more and more significant as the shafts were sunk, and the springs were bored, and the pumps were worked, and the crys tals were gathered. So the grace of God is abundant. It is for all lands, for all ages, for all conditions. It seems to undergirt everythingpardon for the worst sin, com fort for the sharpest suffering, brightest light for the thickest darkness. Around about the salt lakes of Saratov there are 10,000 men toiling day and night, nd yet they never exhaust the saline treas ures. And if the 1,600,000,000 of our race should now cry out to God for His mercy there would be enough for allfor those furthest gone in sin, for the murderer standing on the drop of the gallowB. It is an ocean of mercy, and if Europe and Asia, Africa, North and South America, and all the islands of the sea went down in it to-day they would have room enough to wash and come np clean. Let no man think that his case is too tough a one for God to act upon. Though your 8 in may be deep and raging, let me tell you that Gods grace is a bridge not built on earthly piers, but suspended and spanning the awful chasm of your guilt. One end resting upon the rock of eternal promises and tne other on the foundations of heaven. Demetrius wore a robe so in- crusted with jewels that no one after him ever dared to wear it. Bnt our Ring, Jesus, takes off the rebe of His righteousness, a robe blood dyed and heaven impearled, and reaches it out to the worst wretch in all the earth and says Pnt that on! Wear it now! Wear it forever! Again, the grace of God is like salt ia the way we come at it. The salt on the surface is almost always impurethat which incruits the Rocky Mountains and"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Johns"], "snippet": "did for the three <mark>Johns</mark>!

Several weeks ago the Vincennes citizens leading in the movement for the George Rogers Clark sesqulcen- tenuial obtained options on the prop erty for the city of Vincennes. Mayor Claude Gregg and his board of public works has now ordered the options closed, and notice has been given to the owners that the purchases will be consummated. Tiie property to be bought by the city of Vincennes includes the Emi- son warehouse at First and Vigo streets and all the property of the same depth between Vigo and Barnett streets, Including the St. Johns hotel. As soon as the city acquires the titles to the property, the buildings will be razed, and the ground pre pared for beautification. Tiie George Rogers Clark sesqui centennial commission, headed by William Fortune of Indianapolis, Is planning for the sesquicentennial ob servance of the capture of Fort Sack- ville by George Rogers Clark, in 1928 and 1929, as the major part of its program for observance of the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the conquest of tiie old northwest terri tory by Clark.
