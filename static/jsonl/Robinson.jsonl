Why do you ask? T v e just had all my white Leg horns stolenforty of them. Every one round here is losing chickens. Now those chickens have to be mar keted somewhereand not around here. Its fifty miles to the city, which is the safest place to m arket them. If I stole chickens, Id freight them down, dressed and packed in barrels. So I thought if anybody round here was doing the thieving and the thieves, whoever they are, take the local paper, and certainly do know this part of the county as well as their hand  I m ight get some hint from your shipments. Thats a first rate idea, said the young man. But I dont remember any special shipper of dressed poul try in barrels. The W alter boys pack that way, but I guess were not sus pecting them! Mrs. Dixon sends a barrel now and then. So do the peo ple on the Lawrence farm th ats been an experimental poultry farm for the last year. I hear they report they lost badly through a raid by the thieves two months ago. The Elliotts, over at Orwell, send dressed poultry, too, but never very much. It doesnt seem------- .No, it doesnt, said Dorothy, looking perplexed. But these chick ens have got to get to market, Frank, somehow. Ive started to hunt this county over till I find whats become of them. I guess Id better drive to the other stations up and down the road. Theyd be likely to choose a stupid agent to ship through, so I dnt wonder they keep away from here. Then she flushed a t having paid Frank a compliment, and Frank flushed, too, with pleasure, for he knew that his pretty schoolmate never said things unless she meant them. It p u t him on his mettle. But see here, Dorothy, why do you have to drive up and down the road? W hats the m atter with my telegraphing instead? Come in and sit down, and I ll get you all the in formation you want in half an hour. So Dorothy sat and listened to the clicking w.ires, and took some brief notes on a telegraph pad that Frank pushed over to her across the table. Wagner, at Dorrance station, says that the Lawrence farm sends a bar rel now and then and a crate occa sionally. The Widow Ransom is the heaviest shipper sends both crates and barrels. Jones, at Pond station, says Hank Janeway ships a barrel sometimes so does the Lawrence farm. The Browns send a crate now and then white Leghorns and Ply mouth Rocks. Collins, at Pelham Junction, says that Mrs. Robinson ships more than anybody else, but Jim Henry sends a barrel or a crate now and then, and so does the Law rence peoplePlymouth Rocks, most ly. King, at Bellevue station, says everybody sends in crates, except a barrel now and then from the Law rence people and Sally W alker. Frank leaned back and whistled softly. Dorothy smiled and pushed the telegraph pad under his eyes. Five underlinings marked the name Lawrence repeated in each of the five reports from Milby, Dorrance, Pond, Pelham and Bellevue. You clever girl! said Frank. Youve got hold of the right end. No honest poultry farm ever shipped that much to the city, and through five different stations in small lots. But supposing its so, how are we go ing to prove it? The man doesnt live who can identify an ordinary white Leghorn hen or Plymouth Rock pul let. But the girl does! cried Dorothy, triumphantly. Since day before yesterday I can pick out any one of my forty Leghorns with absolute cer tainty, Frank. I I dipped their legs, every one of them, in a fast black that wont come off, so that I could know them again if they were stolen. Frank Evans lay back in his chair and laughed delightedly. Dorothy, you always were at the head of the class, he said, heartily. But what are you going to do now? Im going to the Lawrence farm , said Dorothy, unfastening the hitch ing strap. You mustnt do that. They might do you an injury. W ait till I can get a constable and a search warrant. You m ustnt go alone, Dorothy. , I wont have it. I dont mind a search w arrant, said Dorothy, with composure. That is what I brought this for. She pulled out the mysterious box, and disclosed various brightly labeled bottles and packages. I am Miss Jane Smith, Frank, agent for these poultry remedies, which I am driv ing about the county introducing among intelligent poultry farmers. I shall get into the Lawrence chicken yards, and come away again without any trouble, thank you. But I should like the constable to be at the end of the lane, ready to come in a little later. Ill get Dick Williams to tend the station, said Frank, and drive over with you p u t the constables and"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Robinson"], "snippet": "Junction, says that Mrs. <mark>Robinson</mark> ships more than anybody"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Robinson"], "snippet": "Junction, says that Mrs. <mark>Robinson</mark> ships more than anybody"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
