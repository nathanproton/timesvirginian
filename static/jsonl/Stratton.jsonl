Faye Stratton, service chair man, announced that 70 of the 9150 goal to purchase a Book Drop Box for the Appomattox County Library, has been collected. Members have been asking Appomattox citizens interested in the library to donate, a dollar or more, toward providing the County library with a facility where patrons can leave books when the library is closed. Anyone interested in donating to the fund is asked to contact Mrs. T. L. Stratton or any member of the chapter to make a contribution. The library pro vides an invaluable service to our community. This is one small way our citizens dm serve the library and at the same time make returning books more convenient for themselves. Xi Gamma Tau announced new officers elected at the previous meeting. Serving the chapter during this coming fiscal year are Janet Noble, president Elaine Stanley, vice president Anne Harris, record ing secretary Faye Stratton, corresponding secretary Shei la Smith, treasurer and Martha Stimpson, extension officer. In other business, plans were finalized for a free Blood Pressure Clinic to be held in co-operation with the Appo mattox County Rescue Squad on two consecutive Saturdays in May. May 8th a clinic station will be set up at Kings in Triangle Plaza from 10 a.m.  2 p.m., and on May 15 a station will be set up at Wilbuns on Rt. 460 from 10 a.m.  2 p.m. Adults, regardless of age, are encouraged to take advantage of this free service, it is painless and takes very little time, yet it can help pinpoint early signs of cardiovascular problems. A couple of moments to check your blood pressure can uncover high blood pressure, a condition which can lead to stroke or heart attack.
