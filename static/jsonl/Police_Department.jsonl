It was absurd to suppose that a frail, slight woman like the Baroness Woronsko could overcome a strong, courageous man like Paul Pelaufski. I had one cine, a clue so slight that it had been overlooked by the Russian police, but one which no really first-class detective would have passed unnoticed. On the dead mans throat were the black marks of the fingers which had strangled him. The thumb of the right hand had been pressed violently into the skin of the neck, so as to produce a deep abrasion. I at once took a careful cast of this thumb-mark with the finest wax, thus reproducing every line exactly. I know that the impression of no two thumbs in the world are alike. It is the prison-mask in China, re member, and there serves the same purpose as the Rogues Gallery in America to identify a criminal. One other clue I had to guide me. A plain twisted ring, worn by the murderer,had left its mark distinctly on the flesh. I caused the impres sion of the hand, ring and all, to be photographed. Furnished only with these slight clues, I now set out to find the mur derer of Paul Pelaufski. Instinct toU me, I suppose, to look for him in the best society of the capital. My Parisian letters of introduction easily opened to me the best houses. In particular I sought the society of the Baroness. I K soon discovered that she was an abandoned intrigu ante. During her husbands absence on his country estates she unscrupu lously amused herself with a lover, one Rudolph Pfesh, a Hungarian of handsome appearance and very finely educated. I soon discovered this man to be a red-hot Nihilist. The Baroness for the time was absolutely infatuated with him. During all this time you may sup pose that 1 kept a sharp lookout for the twisted ring. I did nothing of the kind. Amid the mass of jewelry nightly displayed in the drawing rooms of St. Petersburg one might as well have searched for a needle in a bundle of hay. No, I only hoped to use that as confirmatory evidence when I had found my man. And I was fast finding him. Al ready I had gained, the confidence of the Nihilists. During the third month Rudolph Pfesh confided to .me the outline of a plot to assassinate the Czar. Bombs were to cut no figure in this last attempt. A peculiarly and singularly treacherous method was to be employed. People would never, perhaps, know how the emperor met his death. But who was to inflict it? The circle to which I now belonged, so Pfesh told me, had drawn lots to decide this, and the choice had fallen oh me. 1 was to become the assassin. But the details would not be confided to me until the night before the day set for the execution of the plot. That evening I was to attend at the house of the Baroness Woronsko, when I should receive full instruc tions. The Baronesss house was in the Nevskoi Prospect. It was a huge mansion surrounded by ornamental grounds. Before noon, completely disguised, Pierre Chauffaud took.oc casion to thoroughly reconnoitre the place. Night came. A brilliant ball was in progress. The Baroness had never looked so lovely. In the prime of her womanhood, her figure was displayed to the greatest advantage in evening dreSs. I looked around me. Pfesh, Dakoutsk, Phloblosh and Chenkaminall were there. The gathering was honeycombed with the Nihilistic element. I felt my hand suddenly grasped, and turning around was confronted hyGurloff. He was without dis guise of any kind. I regarded him with wonderment.  The second in command of secret police, he must be well known to these people. Then suddenly it flashed across me. Gurloff is also one of them. Nihilism has penetrated to the police department. I had the fourth dance with the Baroness Woronsko. It was marked a waltz on my programme. She danced superbly.

Long before he embarks in the business he must above all things, learn he derj himself the sweets of praise and the joys oi fame. He must lay aside personal vanity, for his suc cess lies not in forcing himself to the front, but remaining as much as pos sible in the background. He need nave no fear that customers will forget him, for, like a six-shooter, a private detec tive is one of the things that, when needed, is required instanterif not sooner. A modest sign, which the average well-behaved and well-condi- j tioned person might pass every day for j years without noticing, but which looms  up as big as a barn to the jealous wife 1 who wants her husband shadowed, is all  the advertising he needs.

The experiment was done was the Link Driving Simula tors used by the high school to teach Driver Education. The Simulators included a complete Plymouth dashboard, automa tic or manual transmission and foot pedals for acceleration, clutch and brakes. Measure ments would be made and sewed according to errors in braking, steerin g, sign als, lights and speeding. Errors would be scored by three members of the Lynchburg Police Department Blood alco hol concentrations BAC would be measured by a breathalyzer operated by two certified operators and the total experiment would be supervis ed by Mr. Carl F. Pinn, Driver Education Specialist, Lynchb- burg Public Schools. There were eight partici pants ranging in age from 22 to 36 years of age. In order to fam iliarize each participant with the Links Drinking Simulator a practice session was held prior to the actual counting of errors. Once the practice session was concluded each participant operated the Simulator sober with errors being recorded by the police officers. A fter driving the Simulators sober the partici pants were given equal amount of donated alcohol according to body weight in order to achieve a blood alcohol concentration BAC of .08 or higher. Six of the eight participants were measured on a breathalyzer of having a BAC higher than .08. The third phase of the experiment consisted of the participants again taking the Links Driving Simulator Test. This time, of course, each one m easured some degree of intoxication according to the breathalyzer. Consequently, conclusive results were obtain ed from a comparison of driving errors prior to drinking alcohol and driving errors after the consumption of an alcoholic beverage. It is interesting to note that all the participants with a BAC of .08 or higher had a significant degree of impair ment. This ranged from 4 to 71. The range is understand able due to the factors of 1. Individuals sober driving abili ty , 2. Level of .alcohol tolerance. The average impair ment was 27.5 and another significant factor pointed out in the resu lts indicated that steering errors increased 130 after alcohol consumption. IN conclusion, this experi- 1 ment conducted at E . C.

Y.  Mel vin H. Rauch still is making things tough for the crook even though he has retired from the Mount Vernon police department. Rauch, 48, is not toting a gun or a night stick any longer. His new role in the battle against crime is that of an inventor. His invention is a simple, inex pensive metal device that looks something like a slide rule. With it almost any door can be locked from the inside and no key in the world will open the door from the outside. The invention is aimed at those thieves who use skeleton keys, or pass keys, to open doors in hotels, apartments and private homes. The device also guards against a lock being picked. It operates simply. One hooked end of the device is placed in the strike plate or jam. The door is then closed and most of the device which is a thin strip of metal, ex tends on the inside of the door.  A latch then is slid into tight position against the door. Pronto the door is locked so that no key can open it. The latch is slid back ward when a person desires to re move the device and open the door. Rauch said the idea of the in vention came to him during one of nis many investigations of rob beries by thieves who had used skeleton keys to enter a home. His invention is protected by patents and a large manufacturer now is putting the device into pro duction. The device weighs only a few ounces and is no longer than a tooth brush. It can be carried in a mans pocket or in a womans handbag. Rauch says his invention should prove especially helpful to those who travel."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["police", "department"], "snippet": "from the Mount Vernon <mark>police</mark> <mark>department</mark>.

S. defense centers, i 3 the fact that the American people havent been given adequate information to know what a real attack would mean. For one thing, the destructiveness of the bombs now being made in this country and Russia already make the recently-conducted evacuation drills obsolete. The recent drills were based on the possibility of atomic- bomb attacks. Yet the evacuations practiced would not have afforded protection against an attack with more destructive weapons now being made and available. The fall-out of radio-active ash would have caused casualties almost beyond estimation had the recent evacuation drills been the real thing. There has been a dangerous amount of foot-dragging in giving the American people the facts about the new developments in the hydrogen- bomb field. New bombs are so powerful there is practically no defense against them. In addition, there has been a scandalous delay in the production and distribution of detectors which citizens should have in ample numbers to day they should have had them a year or two ago. Without the de tectors it is impossible for the average citizen to know whether he has been contaminated with radio-active ash or fall-out, or not. Yet it was pointed out in Washington that civilian defense officials had only four radio-active measuring counters, or detectors, in that city the national capital when the recent drill took place. Four when a hundred thousand would have been needed! This is necessary because if a person finds he has been subjected to radio-active fall-out he must act immediately, if he is to save his life. And radio activity cannot be detected by the eye, or by feel, until it is too late! The Administration should immediately okay a simple geiger count er, or detector, for manufacture. They should become a part of the equipment of every fire station, police department, and civilian defense organization in the country. The United States is woefully unprepared in the field of civilian de fense  so unprepared it staggers the imagination to think what would happen if this country actually sustained such an attack. The people need the awful facts, and they need a plentiful supply of portable detectors, and that responsibility rests with the Administration."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["police", "department"], "snippet": "of every fire station, <mark>police</mark> <mark>department</mark>, and civilian defense organization"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["police", "department"], "snippet": "of every fire station, <mark>police</mark> <mark>department</mark>, and civilian defense organization"}], "text_match": 1157451471441100921, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2211897868288", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1157451471441100921", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
