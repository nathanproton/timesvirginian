With that help, a new dimension has been added to the rehabilitation of the Mind. When Virginia decided to build its recently dedicated Rehabilitation Center for the Blind, the plans included a recreation wing. Lack of immediate funds from the state, however, curtailed con struction of that wing, the main structure itself requiring hun dreds of thousands of dollar. Into the breach stepped the Lions Club of Virginia, which jointly agreed to come up with the 230,000 in matching funds to go along with a similar sum available from the federal government. Now that 460000 wing i opened and the vital recreation al aspects of rehabilitation are part of the States humanitar-  ian system of restoring norma lity to those stricken with blindness. Recreation put an afflicted person right back into the mainstream with his unaf fected friends and companions. Members of the local Lions Club shared in this worthy project by donating a total of 670.00 last year to the Virginia Rehabilitation Center in Rich mond, according to Dr. C. O. OBrien, Chairman of the Sight Conservation Committee of the Uotas Club ot Appomattox. Local Lions, with Sight. Conservation as their pet project, during the year raised money through the White Cap  81 and the Broom Sale, both annual fund raising project of 1 the local club. The club iso  collected app.oiliuately IVb pairs of glasses donated by the citizens of the county that are provided to worthy applicants, and have purchased 15 pairs of glasses at a cost of 806.00 for persons needing assistance. Appomattox Lions, being interested in preventing blind ness, contributed last year 350.00 to the Old Dominion Eye Bank and Research, Inc., and they have 102 eye donor cards that may be used someday to enable a blind person to see again with a corneal transplant. The Pre vention of the Blind Society is another good organization in Virginia and last year local Lions donated 100.00 to them. Another facet of the work being done by this service dub was the sponsoring last year of the Glaucoma Clinic in the Spring. It was a tremendous success and a project the Appomattox Lions can truly be proud of. . . they feel that it is of great importance to help prevent blindness if at all possible, and, too, it i important to do whatever can be done to help blind persons lead a normal life. ACTIVITIES B o w l i n g ? Swimming? Gymnasium - play room? Dayroom with televis ion, yes all of these can be enjoyed by the blind, and through the efforts of the Lions Clubs in the State of Virginia, these, plus an Assembly Hall for various programs and entertain, are all an integral part of the Rehabilitation Center For The Blind and are located in the recreation wing Contd on Page 13"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["OBrien"], "snippet": "to Dr. C.
