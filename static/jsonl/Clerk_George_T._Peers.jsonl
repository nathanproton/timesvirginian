Mrs. Peers had been in ill health for some time. This summer she spent a portion of the heated srason at Bine Ridge Springs, hoping tq  receive some benefit. She went to Lynch- bnrg some six or seven weeks ago, where she was placed under the case of a physician, but her con dition grew worse, until for more than a week before her death, her relatives and friends had given up all hopes of her recovery. She was fifty-nine yews of age and had lived in this copnty since a few years after her marriage, where her friends may be numbered by the hundreds. Her remains were interredin Lynch burg according to a desire which she had expressed long before her death, As an evidence of the love and esteem in which she was held by the people here, hosts of her friends attended the funeral services in Lynchburg Fridaywe know of no death which could have caused so much sorrow and gloom in our county.

Shortly after her arrival in Lynchburg she became very enti cally ill, and tor several days prior to her death 110 hope of her recovery had been entertained. At the time of her death she was in the fifty-unth year qf her age, and most of her long and useful life was spent iu the county of Appo mattox, where she was universally known and loved. Few persons were better known in Appomato than Mrs. Peers, and none was more highly esteemed or respected. She had been for forty-three years a con sistent member of the Presbyterian church, and her humble Christian life had won for her a place in the hearts of a host of friends, who will not soon recover from the loss occa sioned by her death- Mrs Peers was a daughter of the late Mr. B,"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["George", "T", "Peers", "clerk"], "snippet": "Peers, wife of Mr, <mark>George</mark> <mark>T</mark>. <mark>Peers</mark>, <mark>clerk</mark> of Circuit and County"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["George", "T", "Peers", "clerk"], "snippet": "Peers, wife of Mr, <mark>George</mark> <mark>T</mark>. <mark>Peers</mark>, <mark>clerk</mark> of Circuit and County"}], "text_match": 2314894167592927353, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "4419510927360", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "2314894167592927353", "tokens_matched": 4, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Mr. Hors ley last Week resigned the position of private secretary to Congressman Flood, which oarried a salary of 1, 200 per annum paid by Congress and assumed the management of the Southside Virginian. The resigna tion of Mr. Horsley probably caused Dr. Robertsons early announcement of his candidacy. We are satisfied that there will be other candidates.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.
