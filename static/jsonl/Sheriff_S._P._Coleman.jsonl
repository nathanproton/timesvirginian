E ditor T imbs  I saw an editorial in your excel lent paper some time ago, regarding a graded school at this place. I heartily concur with you about it. It is a good idea, and one that onr citizens shonld take hold of and stop talking of it as an impossibility. Certainly, there is nothing more needed in this vicinity than a good school. Look around here and see what poor advantages onr children have, oompared with the children of other counties. Prince Edward has, within its borders, both a male and female college. Buckingham,through the munificence of Gen. T. M. Lo gan, has a splendid graded school Charlotte and Campbell children both have advantages that are denied ours. If yon will stop a minute yon can see how easy we can get a school here, at a very little coat to any one person. If yon will allow me I will suggest a plan to get it np Suppose some of the leading young men take this m atter in hand and start a subscription to raise funds. We only need abont 500 to start on, and I am certain that the people of old Appomattox can raise it with very little trouble. I wonld Bnggest that Sheriff S. P. Coleman take one of the subscrip tion lists around, as he has proven himself very good at that kind of work and he wonld be particularly interested in this m atter as he has some little ones yet to be educated. Mr. R. F. Burke wonld also make an efficient solicitor, and he is deeply interested in the m atter. There are a number of others I could mention who will do all in their power for the school. I am a great believer in hitting while the iron is hot. - Now, as public opinion is some what aroused on this snbject, let the good people of Appomattox have a mass meeting to put the scheme on foot at once. As yon said in yonr editorial on this snbject, Rome was not bnilt in a day but I never saw a school house as large as the city of Rome, however. It will be remem bered that the founders of Rome went to work and worked hard until it was quite a city, well fortified. We do not wish to build a Rome, bnt a good school.

A right pretty political fight is to take place in this county for the clerkship, which is the best-paid office within the gift of our jieople The present clerk holds od for two more years, and then the will be made for an eight-year term Dr. D. Mott Robertson, late county- treasurer, who resigned that office last summer, has announced to sono of his friends that he will stand fo the Democratic nomination for tb clerkship, and that he will, if elect ed, run the office for the fees alone This would be a saving to the tax payers of nearly 600 per annum, or nearly 5,000 for th\u00e8 term. The election is some distance be fore us, and it is not our purpose to stir up the candidates or the people upon the subject thus early  but we shall fill the field of a newspaper and keep our readers informsd of events as they occur. Among tbi possible candidates we feel warrant ed in mentioning our present sheriff. Mr. S. P. Coleman, who would be u formidable opponent for any aspir ant H. Winston McKinney, the ef ficient deputy clerk, who is perhapi more familiar with the duties of the office, and better qualified for theii discharge, than any other available man. Should he enter the race, he would undoubtedly have the warm support of Mr. George T. Peers, the present clerk  and Mr. Peers would, no doubt, remain in the office for a time to aid him in his work. Mr. J Rolfe Horsley, whom Mr. Peers de feated for the office in 1899, is also likely to be a candidate. Mr. Hors ley last Week resigned the position of private secretary to Congressman Flood, which oarried a salary of 1, 200 per annum paid by Congress and assumed the management of the Southside Virginian. The resigna tion of Mr. Horsley probably caused Dr. Robertsons early announcement of his candidacy. We are satisfied that there will be other candidates. The people are being quietly sounded as to thiB and that man, bat the great majority of them will hardly bind themselves to any one at this stage of the game- none, perhaps, except a few whc be lieve that they ought to be allowed  to shape all the public policies of the connty, and to name all of the officeholders years in advance of the election.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.
