The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

No history of a rural school system of by-gone days is com plete that does not mention the place of the school as a com munity center and the teacher as the leader in the community. Appomattox is no exception. Be cause the school was usually near the center of the communi ty  therefore, in walking dis tance or later driving distance it was used for religious meet ings, especially for Sunday School for those too far to go to churoh, the Grange and other farm organizations. How many people have enjoyed the fellow ship of each other while plann ing and executing box parties, pie suppers, sings, oyster supp ers and bazaars to make money for the school, but at the same time have a little fun along with it. The teachers visit in the home was once a great occasion to teacher, pupil and! parents. Her visit warded off trouble with Johnny as he great to know her as an individual. She could know Johnny better as she saw him in his natural surroundings. After she had spent the night in ihis home she was usually his friend. The teacher was able to introduce new ideas into the home since she usually was one of the most respected individuals of the com munity. She taught Sunday School, played the organ, may be .got up a play or Christmas program at church or school. Unconsciously she was molding opinions. Sometimes she capti vated the heart of a young swain who saw to it that she remained in the community where she reared a family and in turn be came .a patron yes, a better patron than some she had had. As schools grew and roads im proved the whole faculty was invited to supper in a number of the homes. There good food and good fellowship were in such abundance that each person pre sent felt inspired to return to his job and do a better piece of work. To the unknown teacher be longs much of the credit for the progress of the system."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["N", "R", "Featherston"], "snippet": "before becoming superintendent Mi <mark>N</mark>. <mark>R</mark>. <mark>Featherston</mark> 1913- 1926 who was"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["N", "R", "Featherston"], "snippet": "before becoming superintendent Mi <mark>N</mark>. <mark>R</mark>. <mark>Featherston</mark> 1913- 1926 who was"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

He also called attention to the fact that the Appomattox and Buckingham Times as the paper was called then carried in an 1895 issue and article called the History of Surrender. He added that at one time soon after this article appeared that there was a request made that the name of the town Nebraska, as Appomattox was known at that time be changed to Surrender.
