For instance, the first large blitz raid by planes on Moscow was de scribed by the Germans as having ruined the city, particularly the Kremlin. Announcers came on the air the following morning and declared that the raid was much less effective than similar raids the speakers had gone through in England, and that their trips about the city had showed no signs of panic or disaster. j The British commission, which earlier had said that the Russian air force had far from been knocked out of the air, told of German planes shot down, and said that air bat tles they had witnessed showed that the Nazi pilots, in fact the British pilots, did not have as good tech nique as the Russians in clipping off rudders and tail surfaces with machine gun bursts of fire. It also was apparent that Nazi claims on land, that their forces had completely disintegrated that Russian defense, that Smolensk had been taken and that the invaders were past Kiev and had Leningrad practically surrounded were entirely premature. These maneuvers and triumphs might possibly be carried out, but they were some time in the future, those on the ground in Moscow re ported, and the reports were not entirely the Russian communiques, but the reports, censored, it is true, but nevertheless made by Ameri cans and British on the scene. SERVICE And House Chief of Staff General Marshall went before the senate and evident ly made a deep impression. Presi dent Roosevelt followed this with a request for the passage of legisla tion declaring a national emergen cy, and the sum of these two ap pearances before the upper house was evident in two ways First, an effort by administration leaders to hustle the legislation to a vote. Second, a general upturn of senti ment in favor of the bill. This was one of the oddest con troversies since the World war start ed. The first feeling evidenced when it was hinted that the guards men and draftees might be kept in service longer than the statutory year was that the selective service people themselves felt it a breach of faith with the drafted men. The next phase came from the selectees themselves, also from the guardsmen. The officers and non- coms of the latter seemed willing to stay in, but many of the private soldiers among the guardsmen ex pressed voluble desires to be let out. In the midst of this came the an nouncement that all selectees of 28 and over would be deferred auto matically, and the bill to this effect passed the senate by a terrific mar gin. RELEASE For Workers It was said in Washington that if any defense manufacturers want some of their skilled workers, al ready in the guard or the selective service, released to come back to work, the man to take it up with is Robert T. Patterson, undersecretary of war. The recently announced policy will be that trained workers now in the army may be released when their services are urgently needed in de fense industry."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Robert", "Patterson"], "snippet": "it up with is <mark>Robert</mark> T. <mark>Patterson</mark>, undersecretary of war.

Special.Follow ing close upon the disaster of Law yer, 57 miles from here, on Thanks giving Day, which resulted in the death of President Samuel Spencer, of the Southern Railway, and six others, another wreck horror on the Southern occurred in the railway yards here early Saturday morning. Two persons met instant death, an other was fatally wounded and three others were injured. The accident happened about 4 oclock, when northbound train No. 34, a mixed passenger and Pullman train of about 10 coaches, crashed into No. 82, a freight train of 30 oars, which was standing on the main line. All of the passengers es caped injury of any consequence, though all were shaken up. The list of the dead comprises En gineer George C. Kinney, of Tbomas- vllle, N. C., and Brakeman W. B. King, of Danville, Va. Robert Ford, the negro fireman, sustained injuries which will no doubt result in his death. The following is a list of the ser iously injured, who were taken to the General Hospital here O. P. Mull, of Columbia, S. C., flagman H. M. Patterson, of Chatham, Va., brakeman Robert Ford, colored, fireman, and O. O. Mailer, of Wash ington, postal clerk. Both of the trains were running behind time, and the freight train, after passing the blotfk station, three miles south of here, was detained in the yards on account of other trains. The freight had been stand ing on the main line for nearly an hour when No. 34 came around the carve at a rate of about 25 miles an hour. The engine plowed through the caboose of the freight, and like a giant bull hurled it over its head. Engineer Kinney stuck to his post and was instantly killed. Fifty yards above the scene of the accident the negro fireman, realizing what was going to happen, jumped from the locomotive and landed on the ground, unconscious. As soon as the collision occurred fire followed. Four cars were burn ed up and other damaged by the flames. The fire department was called out, and after several hours had the flames under control. Next to the engine on No. 34 was the postal car, which was demolished, and a number of clerks in it were Injured. The injured clerks left on a northbound train, and their injuries are not regarded as serious.  All of the passengers in the Pull man and day coaches escaped. The body of Engineer Kinney was found pinned under the wrecked en gine. It was not mangled, and indi cations showed that he had been scalded to death by the steam es caping from the boiler. The death of W. B. King, who was on the caboose of the wrecked freight train, was frightful. King was learning the business of rail road brakeman, and his body was burned to a crisp. Only the body from the legs to the neck was ex tricated from the wreckage, and this was merely a pile of ashes and co agulated blood. The head, arms and legs were missing, and the ashes was placed in a mall bag and carried to an undertakers shop."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Patterson", "Robert"], "snippet": "C., flagman H.

The origin of the fire is a mystery. One of the factories destroyed was occupied by John B. Anderson  Co., and the other one jointly by the same firm and Mr. Chalmers Patterson, a leaf dealer. Both buildings, which were brick structures, were destroyed, together with their con tents. The Union warehouse, George E. Coleman  Co., proprietors, was badly damaged. J. B. Anderson  Co. are the heaviest losers by the fire. They had to bacco valued at 75,000 stored in the house and carried 69,000 insurance. Lee BarksdaJe, colored, an escaped prisoner from the chain gang, was shot Danville by Alfred Henderson, colored, who had, als6 escaped from the chain Vang. Barksdales wound, which is in the shoulder, is not considered dangerous. A dynamite explosion at the Clayton mines, operated by the Pulaski Company, near Pulaski, lcilled William Goings, col ored, a blacksmith, and dangerously wounded his 14-year-old son. A third of a box of the explosive had been left in the blacksmith shop, where the men were working. How it was exploded is not known. The shop was blown into kindling wood and all the clothes were blown off of the dead man. He had been at work only a short time when the ex plosion took place. Henry Purden, the 9-year-old son of Captain Purden, of the Seaboard Air Line Railway, Portsmouth, has lockjaw and is likely to die. He fell from a tree several days ago and suffered a com pound fracture of his arm. Both bones were broken and the flesh was badly lacerated. Gangrene has developed and there is little hope of saving the boys life. ,  But for the timely arrival of several men Miss Annie Dixon, who conducts a fashionable hairdressing parlor for la dies on the fifth fl6or of the Law Build ing, on Main Street, Lynchburg, would have been burned to death. Miss Dixon was using an alcohol lamp, which cx-. ploded, throwing the burning fluid over her clothing Instantly she was in a light blaze.. She ran to a nearby bath room, screaming as she went, and en deavored to throw water upon the flames. She returned to her parlor and there she was thrown to the floor and rolled in a rug, which completely extinguished the fire. Miss Dixon was severely injured and all her clothing from her waist up was burned off her. The police authorities of Stephen City are investigating the discovery of a heal thy looking white baby, about 2 weeks old, that was mysteriously placed on the front porch of the residence of John Massie, in the suburbs of that town, while the family were absent. Suspicion is said to point to a woman whose name the police refuse to divulge. At Mountain City, near Bristol,- Jeff Church has been sentenced to 10 years in the penitentiary for the murder of James Campbell. The citizens are said to be indignant over the verdict. The murder was a brutal one, Church having tramped his victims face while the latter was pleading for mercy after he had been shot- -2 times,. Buried for nearly an hour under sev eral tons of lumber was the frightful ex perience of John Haines, a teamster from Hampshire County, West Virginia, in Winchester. He is lat Memorial Hos pital in a precarious condition. A wheel of the wagon which Haines was driving fell off and the lumber wagon upset, pinning Haines under the heavy lad. Two laage sturgeons, one weighing 300 pounds and the other about 200 pounds, were captured in the Rappahan nock river at the foot of the falls above Fredericksburg.

The offer was made by the Tide water Railway Company, which recently purchased the fair grounds of 30 acres, lying a half mile east of the Gish farm. The offer must be accepted wthin ten days or it will be withdrawn. Roanoke business men say it indicates that Ro anoke is to have the shops of the new road.  Superintendent of Construction J. F. Wrenn, of the Tidewater Railroad, an nounced that Wm. J. Oliver, represent ing Sands  Oliver, of Roanoke, had closed a million-dollar deal with the Southern Railway. The contract calls for the double-tracking of the Southern from Morristown to Knoxville and the building of a branch line from Chatte- nooga to Stephenson, all in Tennessee. Sands  Oliver were recently relieved oi a part of ttheir contract tto build the roadbed for the first tuo miles of the Tidewater. Superintendent Wrenn says the contractors get 2,ooo,oou for build ing a mile-long tunnel between Knoxville and Morristown, which is now being constructed under Lookout Mountain. Wallace W. Hunter, capitalist and for mer treasurer of Norfolk for 12 years, shot himself in the mouth in Elmwood Cemetery. He was found an hour after ward and sent to St. Vincents Hospital. He was conscious, but too weak for an operation. The bullet, came out at the top of his head, and the surgeons, when they had examined the wound, said there was little hope of his living. Mr. Hunter is 68 years of age and has long com plained of ill health. His wife was Miss Grandy, the sister of the wealthy banker, C. Wiley Grandy, and he has a son and daughter, both grown. The only ex planation of the shooting is Mr. Hun ters ill health. He was well educated, popular and of high character. The resignation of Rev. Dr. Robert J. McBridge as rector of Robert E. Lee Memorial Episcopal Church, of Lexing ton, has been accepted by the vestry. Dr. McBridge goes to St. Georges Church, Fredericksburg. For over 22 years Dr. McBridge has been pastor of Lee Memo rial Church, and he is greatly beloved here.
