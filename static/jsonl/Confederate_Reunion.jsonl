John S. Mosby was held at Ber- ryville, near which place during the war Mosbys men made many daring exploits. The meeting was presided over by Col. Joseph Bryan, of Rich mond. Hon. Marshall McCormick de livered the address of welcome and a memorial from the pen of Col. John Alexander, of Leesburg, on the death of Chaplain Sidney Ferguson was read. J. William Foster was elected president and H. S. Ashby adjutant. The reunion closed tonight with an entertainment by Polk Miller and his Old South Quartet. At its regular meeting Garland Rodes Camp, Sons of Veterans, of Lynchburg, selected as their sponsor for the coming Confederate reunion Miss Rebecca Martin and as maid of honor Miss Norvie Craighill. both of that city. The Veterans have invited ex-Gov. Francis T. Nichols, who is spending the summer at Chase City, to attend the reunion and be one of the speakers. _ A call was issued by George E. Caskie, chairman of the executive committee of the Virginia Sunday- School Association, for the-State con vention to be held at Lynchburg Oc tober 3 to 5 . A large number of local committees will go to work at once arid arrange for a large attend ance. The last State convention was hqld at Petersburg in March, 1902.   George W.

James Norton, of Medford,_ Mass., has discovered what he claimi to be the richest nickel mine in the United States on the edge of Floyd county, 10 miles south o f ShaWsville, on the Norfolk and Western railway. The lead is said to be large and Mr. Norton has ordered machinery for de veloping the property.

The City Engineer, of Roanoke, is sued a building permit to the Norfolk and Western Railway for the erection of a new passenger station in that city at an estimated cost of 99,000. The Roanoke City Council enacted a Pure Food and Milk law. A drastic anti-gambling ordinance just enacted by the Roanoke City Council provides for a fine of not less than 50 nor more than 500 fot gaming. Mayor Cutchin says that he will permit no games of chance at the Roanoke fair in September. Mayor Joel H. Cutchin, of Roanoke, who was recently re-elected, in an in terview said he had given his time, attention and very best efforts to the city for two years and that his poli tical opponents have made the posi tion as unpleasant as possible. The Council, he says, has continually fought him in everything he attempts to do in the interest of the city, and recent proceedings he fears is an in dication that the same tactics will con tinue in the new Council. If so, he cannot and will not stand it. Some whom he thought were. his friends have shown an animosity that does not please him. He says the salary, which is less than any officer, police man or blacksmith of the city, is no compensation for the duties he is called upon to perform, to say nothing of a continual wrangle with the Coun cil, which is annoying to him and humiliating and distasteful to his rela tives and family. The Mayor says that the office has destroyed his law business and the continued harassing has injured his health and peace of mind. He says that if present condi tions continue no gentleman can- or will be Mayor of Roanoke. W. E. Ehoflf, 26 years old, is under arrest at Newport News on the charge of housebreaking, committed nearly six years ago. Ehoff was then living with his parents in Newport News.

The celebrated suit for divorce of Mrs. Olivia Thurman from her hus band, Gen. Charles Thurman, a rich landowner of Clarke county, which has been before the public frequently during the last year, was settled out of court. A decree will be entered giving Mrs. Thurman a divorce a mens et thoro, which will become absolute in three years, when alimony will cease. Caroline County Camp of Confed erate Veterans has decided to raise 2,500 for the erection of a monument to the Confederate soldiers of that county who were killed or died in the service. Rev. A. C. Knibb. a ministerial stu dent at the Virginia Christian Colege, of Lynchburg, has been conducting a protracted meeting in a tent in West Lynchburg for six weeks and nearly 300 persons have professed conver sion.

It Is fitting that, while paying tribute to those who fought va liantly for the Southern cause, we should now look forward to the future We are proud of the Virginia of the p u t and of the record which her sons have made In peace and in war, and we are confident of her future hut we may be permitted to hope that her achievements hereafter shall be more In peace than In war. Virginians will be ever ready to uphold the honor of the State and of the United States on the field of battle, when that Is necessary, hat, with the horrors of the war In Europe to refresh our mem ories of the campaigns of the veterans here assembled, we may well pray for such progress In the civilization of the world and for such wisdom and strength In our government that om people may never again hear the call to arms. , Duty to Industry. In any event, thank God, we are now at peace and K Is therefore our present duty as a people so to guide the progress of the State along the paths of peace that the history of our day may he, without neglect of spir itualities, one of material progress, advancing he happiness and prosper lty of our descendants. Leaving to others, for the moment, the appeal for progress In Virginia on the spir itual. the educational, and- the aesthetic ldeu of our civilization, 1 venture to say a word of stimulus In behalf of oinwpresent duty to Industry In any review of the progress of Virginia we should never forget the condition In which she was left at ths dose of the war between the States, when her fields had been a battle ground for four years, when thousands of her sons had fallen, when many ol those who survived were maimed oi shattered In health, when property had been destroyed, when a large part of her territory had been cut off and when public and private credit and most of ail, her moral efficiency had been seriously Impaired. In he fac of such handicaps the record of actual progress since IKS Is a splendid tribute to the men and women who, after Appomattox, sat about tire task of rebuilding with Indomitable perser ranee and splendid self-sacrifice They have laid a broad foundation Cor us In our turn to build upon and In ths earns spirit which animated them we should press forward to new achievements. Principles ef Progress In this great undertaking It will ha wall always to keep before ns the prln cl pies of tree progress which are that enduring success Is the product of a restless willingness to do new things, If they shall seem good In the experi ence of others to be discontented with anything bat the heat, and t endure any sacrifice that may ha re gnlred. Dissatisfaction with existing condi tions has ever been one of the most potent motives of human progress. It te fitting, therefore, to see In what Yaspeets wa may have reason to be dissatisfied with material things they are In Virginia. Without neglect of manufactures wa are still eminently an agricultural peo pie, as Thomas Jefferson hoped might ever be. Climate and soil con ditions throughout the state are fav orable to diversified and profitable agriculture. The statistics show that have availed of these conditions by largely increasing our farm values Inoreaeed Farm Values. The United States Census Bureau Mis ue that the value of all farm property In Virginia Increased from 924T.m.53, hi lfi0, to 9525,065.883, In 1910. On its fees, an Increase ol 169 per cent In thirty years does not look bad, hut should ws ho satisfied when we compare It with an Increase of 227 per cent In tbe neighboring State of North Carolina and when we appreciate that it Is much less than It would have been If farm production had been brought up more nearly to what our natural advantages give us the right to expect? When we review the average production of the staple farm crops of Virginia we find abun dant reasons for dissatisfaction and great opportunities for Improvement. The corn crop of the State ranks first In money value. The United States Agricultural Department re ports that, for the ten years from 1996 to 1914, the average yield of corn per acre In Virginia was 24.2 bushels. The average for the United States was 26.6 bushels. Conneoticot, where natural conditions are certainly no more fav orable than In this State, had an aver age of 48.4 bushels, and a long Met of States were ahead of Virginia. With Individual Virginia farmers making records of from fifty to more then one hundred bushels we eertalnly have reason to be dissatisfied with our aver-"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Reunion", "Confederate"], "snippet": "Address at the Annual <mark>Reunion</mark> of <mark>Confederate</mark> Veterans at Flsnera Hill,"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Reunion", "Confederate"], "snippet": "Address at the Annual <mark>Reunion</mark> of <mark>Confederate</mark> Veterans at Flsnera Hill,"}], "text_match": 1157451471306883193, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2211897802752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1157451471306883193", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

E ditor When this is read, if read at all, the great meeting we have been looking forward to at the Tabernacle with hope, faith and works will be in its fifth day. A few years ago the reunion of Confederate soldiers was held in Richmond. What a good time we had! How we love the olo boys yet! What a joy to tell of the fights, wounds and hardships encountered. What a pleasure it was to obey or ders from our beloved commander. Infantry, cavalry and artilery all iu the line of march. So in this meet ing all Soldiersof the Cross can fall in line and march under the great commander to the city of the eternal habitation. Come and hear for your self. If you come iri the right spirit you will feel as Peter did on the Mount of Transfiguration. Certain- We can do nothiug of yourself. Come,! Mr. Editor, and bring some friends with you. You and your horse will be well cared for, I have no doubt, for about 1.00 per day on the grounds. Well, ifcs Parker and Davis. 1 did so wish it could have been Bryan aud Gray. I stick to what I said first, Bryan is the biggest man in these United States. He will tell Teddy a thing or two tefore the eve of November. We a e proud of Teddy climbing the hill of San Joe aud when Parker is elected will sign a petition to give him a big com mand in the next war we have. He needs a boss. I expect Parker will make a very good one. Our old friend and neighbor, John Flood, died this p. m., and will be buried at his late home Sat urday evening. He said he had no fears of death and was trusting in the Lord. He had been sick for several j months. He ssid from the first it was sickness unto death, and that he would not live until the meeting at theTabernacle. Dont forget the great meeting at Bethel the second Saturday aud Sunday in August. It will be con tinued through the week. Pray for its success. Our crop of wheat and oats are good and the corn and tobacco are looking well. I attended the meeting of the Board of Supervisors last Monday. The first meeting I ever attended. I am going again. I was struck with the youthful appearance of the Board. They were all known to me, but it was the first time I had ever seen them together. They had fir-t. tirst-olasa order aud they were brim ful of business. The collection of dog tax and the reward for varments was discussed and ordered the pub lic roads seen after and the publi cation monthly c.f the Boards pro ceedings. From what I saw and heard Buckingham has a good Board of Supervisors who are careful of iis finance. Good night and success to the A.  B. T im e s . P. S.To-day will long be remem bered no doubt, as it wilt be the commencement of the Forbes burn ii.g cases in court. How we do wish that the guilt of the guilty may be clearly established. Bettor for ninety-nine guilty to go unpunished thau for one innocent to suffer. A goodly congregation was at the Tabernacle yesterday, probably not so large a crowd as usual on Sun day, The benches were pretty well filled with the best i ehayed crowd for its size this writer has ever seen. The meeting closed for the evening with three at the altar. Only two preachers were on the ground, Rev Mr. Hypes, of Roanoke, and Rev. David Morris, of Shreveport, La., a student at Asbury, Ky. Dr. Me Laurren will probably be there to day. He must have been in a wreck, sidetracked or something of the sort, s he did not come Friday. Revs. Mr. Banks and Heckman will be there to-morrow.
