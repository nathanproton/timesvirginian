Post Office at what is bow Appo mattox, Virginia. Information secured from Nation al Archives and the Post Office De partment, Washington, D. C., tells an interesting story of a full cen tury of mail service here. There have been 20 postmaster andor acting postmaster ap pointments in the 100 years of operation and the incumbent, E. LeRoy Smith, has served longer than any other. The name of the office has been changed several times. On February 23, 1855, a fourth class post office was established here and was call ed Nebraska, Virginia. The first postmaster was Samuel D. McDear- mon. Salary amounted to 6.01. The office operated under the name of Nebraska, Virginia until September 21, 1894, when it was changed to Appomattox. However, due to confusion with the Old Ap pomattox Court House community, the \u00f1am\u00e9 of the post office here changed on January 15, 189 to West Appomattox, Virginia. It oper ated under that name until June 27, 1906, when it took the present name of Appomattox, Virginia. The office became third class in 1909 and second class in 1987. In mid-1955 it is scheduled to become first class, due to volume of busi ness. Several years ago it became first class, but reverted to second class due to a shift in parcel post business. The following is a list of post masters and their terms Samuel D. MeDearmon, February 23, 1855 Richard H, Mavin, December 31. 1855 Robert I, Boaz, October 4, 1866 Thomas E. Walton, December 22 1867k D- Hix, April 20, 1869 Willbfo l CoIKntf April 1 , i860 Mrs. Mary J. Atwood, February 10, 1666.  Ada A. Landrum, June 26, 1866 N. H. Gregory, October 30, 1867 Miss Elizftb\u00e9th H. Dee, J\u00e1niury 21, 188 Rufus Furdum, January 1, 1873 Samuel H. Coleman, July 26, 1889 John S. Plunkett, May 9, 1898 Robert Irby, May 7, 1897 Leslie F. Ferguson, May 20, 1918 Robert Irby, April 28, 1922 Lula G. Irby, Acting Postmaster. Ap ril 21, 921 Alfred R. Harwood, Acting Poet- master, May 15, 7931 Joseph E. Dinwiddle, June 1, 1982 E. LeRoy Smith, Acting Poet- master, June 1, 1034 Regular Appointment, March 8, 1936. However, this was not the first pqst. office in what is now Appomat tox County, Tie following inform ation  supplied by the National Archives and reports of the Post Office Department Appomattox County, Virginia The records show that this office was established on April 1, 1811, under the name of Floods, Buckings ham County, Virginia, with Thomas Trent the first postmaster. It is shown that the name oi the county was changed to Prince Edward on March 22, 1837, that the name of the office was changed to Clover Hill on July 7, 1837 and that the county in which the office was lo cated was changed to Appomattox sometime between September 23, 1845 and June 30, 1849. The re cords show that the name of the office was changed to Appomattox Court House on February 3, 1859 and changed to Appomattox on July 3, 1892.  It therefore appears that the his tory of a post office at what is now without a post office but known as Old Appomattox Court House, is equally interesting. That part of the county was in Buckingham when the post office was established as Floods in 1811. Later it became a part of Prince Edward and finally Appo mattox in 1845. Shortly after the burning of the court house in 1892, the court house was rebuilt at what is now the Town of Appomattox, and final ly the post office at the historic old village was discontinued. It was of ficially Appomattox Court House, Virginia, at the time Gen. Lee sur rendered to Gen. Grant. Undocumented stories often told here relate that in the gold rush days a hundred years and more ago?- some family started out for Ne braska, got this far and liked the place so much that they decided to settle here and call this Nebraska.

From early youth she was a faithful and devot ed member of Liberty Baptist Church, and was a pillar of strength in its organizations and Church life. We pay tribute to her life of in spiration and accomplishments. She was devoted to her children, family, and home always loyal to her friends true to her convictions strong in her Christian faith, and optimistic in her outlook. Even unto the end her thoughts and plans were in consideration of others. In spite of her progressing ill. ness she kept up with her usual in terests with a courageous spirit. In no greater way did she exemplify her bravery than in her efforts to seek and use every known means of medical treatment, not solely for the purpose of her own recovery but also that others similiarly strick en might be helped.

Bills prohibiting the manufacture or sale of other than safety matches, to tax automobiles for county road purposes, to create a department of mines, to amend tax laws, reducing assessments on the first 1,000 of household goods from 35 cents to 10 cents to amend the code, and to prescribe order of procedure In court cases, were introduced. The Senate resolution, offered - by Senator Echols, of Augusta, for the formal election of United States sena tors at noon on Tuesday, January 23, and a joint election on Wednesday, the 24th, was concurred in by the House. The Senate concurred In a House resolution to arrange a joint session for February 22, when the State of Texas will present a portrait of Gen. Sam Houston to Virginia. Democratic Floor Leader Martin Williams, of Giles county, is strenu ously opposing the proposed tax com mission bill in Its present form, averr ing that it is not fair to Giles and other southwestern counties of the State rich in mineral deposits and other natural resources. Another measure which will meet with oppo sition is the Stenbenson bill to abol-, lsh gambling. Delegate Banks, from Norfolk, says the bill will mean the death of horseracing and bookmaking at the Jamestown racstrack. The Senate and House held a joint session and unanimously elected W. D. Saunders State dairy and food com missioner, and J. Richard Wingfield member of .the State Corporation Com mission. The House concurred in the Senate resolution to do away with the pres ent system of leasing convict labor, and calling upon the joint committees on roads to consider the Governors message relative to roads and work ing convicts thereon. Bills were introduced in the House to prohibit treating in saloons to place local milk inspectors under juris diction of the State Dairy and Pure rood Commission to compel State employes to work from 9 to 5 oclock each day. The Senate concurred iu the House rneasuYe to close the hunting season at once to protect game. One bill of State-wide interest in the Senate makes it necessary to se cure a State license to carry deadly or dangerous weapons. -Senator Paul, of the Republican mi nority, is working in the interest of a measure to have at least one Repub lican on every electoral board throughout the State. The bill for a change in the city charter of Richmond for the creation of an administrative board, previously passed by the House, was passed in the Senate under a suspension of the rules, and now goes to Governor Mann for his signature. Delegate Cox, of Richmond, intro duced a resolution providing that Gov ernor Woodrow Wilson, of New Jer sey, be invited to address  joint ses sion of the legislature and of the Rich mond City Council on Thursday night, February 1, at 8 oclock. The resolu tion was unanimously passed, and when sent to the Senate was concur red in. One of the most Important bills in troduced in the House was presented by Delegate Harwood, of Richmond, providing for the amendment to the section of the code governing the state tax on corporations for the sup port of free schools, pensions and liquidation of the public debt. The present law provides a maximum fee of 600, imposed upon a company with a capital of 1,000,000, while on a company capitalized at 999,000 the tax is 199.80. It was announced in both Houses that the joint committee on roads would have a public hearing on the questions of roads and workirfe con victs thereon, according to the recom mendations of Governor Mantl, on Monday, January ?9. One of the provisions of the charter amendment bill for the city of Rich mond, which has passed both Houses of the legislature and is now in thte hands of Governor Mann for his signature, reads that the city has the right to erect and maintain, in con nection with the city prison, if the I Council so determines, a suitable  workhouse and a bouse of correction, to compel and require all able-bodied i adult prisoners confined to perform anual labor in such workhouse and to  employ all youthful prisoners in the house of correction. Many representatives of the south west section of the state were here t,o oppose any changes in the redistrict ing of the Ninth district, the Dem ocrats believing that if the district is left undisturbed they have an excel lent chance to elect a successor to Congressman Bascom Slemp, the in cumbent, in the coming November election. , ."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Harwood"], "snippet": "was presented by Delegate <mark>Harwood</mark>, of Richmond, providing for"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Harwood"], "snippet": "was presented by Delegate <mark>Harwood</mark>, of Richmond, providing for"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Had the 147 votes been count ed as sworn to be cast for Har wood and Clement, Harwood would have had a majority over Mr. Burke of 31 votes and Clement a majority over Mr. Flood of 53 votes. It is claimed for most of the 147 excluded voters four years ago, that they have unquestion ably purged them elves of every objection by voting the Democratic ticket at general elections for four years. Upon challenge any voter who can say that at the last general election November inwhich he or she voted they voted the Dem ocratic ticket and will support the Democratic ticket at nxt election shall be allowed to vote and no judge of election who re gards his oath of office will do anything to deprive such person of the right to vote. All persons qualified to vote in the primary, should register and cast a vote in this important election. There are more than 2300 eligible voters on the list as tax-payers, and it is expected that 2,000 of them will go to the polls on election day. With such a vote cast no man can complain of the expression rendered for or against him."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Harwood"], "snippet": "test by A R. <mark>Harwood</mark> and A H.
