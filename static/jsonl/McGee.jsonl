A brief account by Dr. McGee, of the Nurse Corps of the Army as it exists now, has recently been published in the journal of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States. A pre vious article describe! the conditions attending the appointment of trained women nurses for army duty, which began In May, 1808 , and culminated n September, when about 1200 were employed. Between then and tbe pres ent time they have served In the Uni ted States, Cuba, Porto Rico, Hawaii Japan and tbe Philippines, and even In the Chinese campaign. The number Is now fixed at 100 on active duty, with a small body of reserves who have seen active service and are ready to an- wer future calls. Trained nurses are permanently stationed at the army hospital at San Francisco, at the one for tuberculosis at Fort Bayard. N. M. ind at the largest hospitals In the Phil ipplnes. They are temporarily sent to iny post where they may be needed. They serve under a section of tbe army reorganization law framed in 1900 , which provided that the medical de partment should consist of specified medical officers, of the enlisted men of the hospital corps, and of the nurse rorps female. A superintendent Is stationed in the surgeon generals office and a chief nurse Is at each of the hospitals where nurses are serving. Recent regulations provide for an ex amination In nursing, cooking and al lied subjects before promotion from the grade of nurse to that of chief nurse. Women are employed with marked success as teachers of nursing and cooking In. the two schools main tained to give brief preliminary In struction to tb? hospital corps recrnlts. Dr. McGee urges that In the future the nurse corps be more largely util ized In giving systematic ward train ing to fit the hospital corps men for their duties In the smaller hospitals where they have no trained supervis ion. She also recommends the gradual formation of a large corps of reserves who have received some post-graduate military training.American Medicine."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["McGee"], "snippet": "brief account by Dr. <mark>McGee</mark>, of the Nurse Corps"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["McGee"], "snippet": "brief account by Dr. <mark>McGee</mark>, of the Nurse Corps"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Yoshjo Kot- suki, commander of the enemy  forces in Korea, approached. He re-  fused the request of the Americans I to see Allied prisoners and also re- j fused to give the names and nation-  alities of the prisoners. Drinks, Songsand Guns. The mercy team and the crew of the plane put up for the night be cause the Japanese commandant was unable to. get enough gasoline for the C-47 Us leave immediately. The Japanese meantime brought up two tanks and set up trench mor tars around the plane. A 37 milli meter cannon covered the party. During the night the Japanese en tertained the Americans with beer sake and Japanese songs. Flight Officer Edward McGee of Durant, Okla.p_ commenting on the scene said If someone had told me two weeks agp Id be in a setup like this I would have turned him over to the lo\u00e7pward. Although tne? members of the team were armed with revolvers, tommy-guns and hand grenades just in case of trouble, Capt. Patrick Teel of New York City, who was with the flrst Ranger battalion at Anzio, said Itll take just five minutes to make us all dead ducks. The flight to Korea from Sian en tailed a journey of almost 1,000 miles over Japanese occupied terri tory. As the plane got within 500 miles of Keijo the radio operator, Lt. Meredith L. Price of Charleston, W. Va., attempted to establish contact with the Japanese. We are expecting you and we guarantee you safe conduct, the Japanese said. When the plane landed, Maj. Gen. Junjiro Ihara, chief of staff for the Japanese forces in Korea, asked Col- Sird his mission.  Just Looking Around. The American officer replied that he was in Korea as the initial pre- Allied occupation representative to bring whatever help is needed by Allied prisoners of war and to make preliminary arrangements for fu ture evacuation in accordance with the terms of the peace negoti ations. Then youre not here to negotiate a surrender? Ihara asked. No, our mission is purely humanitarian, Bird replied. Ihara said that the prisoners were well and were being cared for. but that the party could not see them. During supper that night the Jap- anese were quite convivial. After singing Japanese soncs, one asked, What is the American air force song? Led by Capt. John Wagoner of the air transport command, from Grand Island, Neb., the Americans let loose with the chorus of Off we go into the wild blue yonder. The Japanese beamed and beat time on the table with their fingers. After the Americans finished, the Japanese sang their air force sons The Fighting Wing. The next day the atmosphere be came tense again. When Bird asked a Japanese officer to sign a note saying the mission had arrived but was refused permission to act, the major swore and made stinging ref erences to inferior persons. Shortly afterward the guard around the plane was increased. The gasoline finally was poured into the big ship and the Americans and Koreans took off on the return flight."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["McGee"], "snippet": "songs.

Leavenworth, Kan. Special. Mich ael Kelly, an insane man, at the office of the Robert Garrett Lumber Com pany, in the business district, shot six persons,. killing one, probably fatally wounding another and more or less seriously wounding four others. He was himself finally killed by officers who tried to overpower him. Kelly had lived in Leavenworth for years and at different times engaged in minor business enterprises. He was eccentric, and during the Presidential campaign in 1896 lost his mind entirely. At that time he threatened to kill Gar rett. He was arrested and adjudged insane, Garrett and four others testify ing against him. After a year in the Topeka Asylum Kelly was released. Recently he had been acting queerly again, and declared that he would kill the five men who sent him to the asy lum. For the last two weeks he has been practicing shooting with a pistol at the Fort Leavenworth range. Tues day night he drank heavily. Soon after noon Wednesday he went to Garretts office and without warning shot Garrett as he sat at his desk. Garrett fell to the floor and Kelly de liberately fired four more shots into the body. Leaving his victim for dead, Kelly ran to the rear of the lumber yard and began reloading his pistol. Returning to the office he found Dr. McGee, who had been attracted by the shooting, bending over Garrett. Kelly fired at the physician, the bullet strik ing Dr. McGee in the spise, and he fell near where Garrett lay. Then followed an exciting street fight between the madman and officers who came upon the scene. Kelly, flourish ing his pistol, ran through the lumber yard. He met Isaac Healer, a laborer, and shot him in the hand. A few yards further on he encountered Sergeant Dodge. The two exchanged shots as they ran. One bullet from Kellys weapon struck Dodge in the neck, but not before that officer had shot the madman in the shoulder. Kelly kept running and was soon confronted by Detective McDonald and Policeman  Falthager. McDonald dropped Kelly  with a bullet in the neck. Dodge raised 1 his pistol but it failed to work, and  catching up with the murderer he crushed his skull with the weapon. Kelly was carried to the station in an unconscious condition, dying soon after his arrival."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["McGee"], "snippet": "office he found Dr. <mark>McGee</mark>, who had been attracted"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["McGee"], "snippet": "office he found Dr. <mark>McGee</mark>, who had been attracted"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Another Iowan, GOP Rep. H. R. Gross, sees it as an almost incredible, unconscionable move at this moment. What has aroused their congressional ire is a move on the part of some of their colleagues to push for a pay raise for members of Congress and other top federal officials. The lawmakers how receive 42,500 a year. Under the proposals, that figure would be increased to somewhere between 55,400 and 58,400 by 1977.
