A right pretty political fight is to take place in this county for the clerkship, which is the best-paid office within the gift of our jieople The present clerk holds od for two more years, and then the will be made for an eight-year term Dr. D. Mott Robertson, late county- treasurer, who resigned that office last summer, has announced to sono of his friends that he will stand fo the Democratic nomination for tb clerkship, and that he will, if elect ed, run the office for the fees alone This would be a saving to the tax payers of nearly 600 per annum, or nearly 5,000 for th\u00e8 term.

Mr. J Rolfe Horsley, whom Mr. Peers de feated for the office in 1899, is also likely to be a candidate. Mr. Hors ley last Week resigned the position of private secretary to Congressman Flood, which oarried a salary of 1, 200 per annum paid by Congress and assumed the management of the Southside Virginian. The resigna tion of Mr. Horsley probably caused Dr. Robertsons early announcement of his candidacy. We are satisfied that there will be other candidates. The people are being quietly sounded as to thiB and that man, bat the great majority of them will hardly bind themselves to any one at this stage of the game- none, perhaps, except a few whc be lieve that they ought to be allowed  to shape all the public policies of the connty, and to name all of the officeholders years in advance of the election.

It was the original work of Joseph Burns, who died in Washington January 10, 1895. He was either at the Surrender in 1865 or visited Appomattox very shortly thereafter. He made succeeding visits for sketches on the village and carried on an extended correspondence with the late George T. Peers, clerk of the court here in 1865. It is believed that Burns replica is the most auth entic record of the detailed appear ance of Old Appomattox Court House in existance.

R. Atwood, and re cently found by her daughter, Miss Lynolee Atwood, of Richmond, re veals valuable historical information on the establishment of the Memor ial Cemetery at Old Appomattox, and shows that it was the work of an organization here which was the local forerunner of the chapter of the United Daughters of the Con federacy. Mrs. Calvin Robinson, president of the U. D. C., today released con tents of this aged notebook, supplied her through the cooperation of H. A. Gurney, Custodian here for the National Park Service. It appears that on Friday, May 18, 1866, the ladies of Old Appo mattox Court House and vicinity met in the court room to form a Ladies Association similar to the Ladies Memorial Association in oth er parts of the South. The object was to provide suitable interment for the Confederate Soldiers and to preserve the final resting place as a memorial. Temporary officers were Presi dent, Mrs. E, W. Leyburn Secre tary, Mrs. L. K. Read Treasurer, Mrs. J. C. Peers. On May 25, 1866, a second meeting was held and the first officers were chosen, to serve for one year President, Mrs. E. W. Leyburn Vice-President, Mrs. Eliz. Johns Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. Ella W. Flood Recording Sec retary, Mrs. Lizzie K. Read Treas urer, Mrs. Jonnie C. Peers. At this meeting Mr. Joel W. Flood offered to give land for the purpose of a cemetery. Among the first members were Mesdames E. W. Leyburn, Elizabeth Johns, Jennie C. Peers, Lizzie K. Read, Bettie Tweedy, Sally F. Ab- bitt, Mary Christian, Mollie Mc- Dearmon, Msdlie M. Graff, and the Misses Eliza Lirburn, Belle Met. Leyburn, Bettie D. Johns Mary W. Johns, Carrie A. Hix, Martha A. Hix, Mollie E. Sears, Sue Sears. Mr. John Sears offered to donate land, upon a beautiful knoll one-half mile west of the Old Court House for the Cemetery, and Mr. George T. Peers prepared the deed. Major Flood donated timber for a fence. Capt. Wm. H. Trent and Maj. Flood arranged to haul the timber. Mr. Francis Meeks cleared the ground for the Memorial Cemetery. An early feature of the Ladies Organization was a series of memor ial addresses. Col, Farrar made the entertained by Maj. Wilmer Mc Lean. A Tableau was presented as a means of raising funds. A similar ladies group in Charlotte offered to help. The digging of the graves for the Veterans was done by Messers. Geo. T. Peers, C. H. Sackett, P. N. Meade, J. W. Webb, R. R. Kyle, Geo. A. Abbitt, E. G. Hix, and Maj. McLean. The abov, with the aid of John W. McKinney, John Sears, William Paris, R. M. Sweeney, Thomas S. LeGrande and Thomas A. Smith, re-interred the bodies of the Veter ans November 30, 1866. Mr. R. B. Poore made the memor ial address in 1868. Capt. Miles C. Mason, Fayette Artillery, Va., was buried in grave No. 1. Sgt. O. F. DeMemse, Donald- sonville Artillery, La., grave No. 2. The names of those interred in the first and was gbest of Wilmer Me in the next ten unknown. Later the Ladies Associateion be came the U. D.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co.

Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.
