The sidewalks will be build along Routes 460 and 131.

Under the agreement, the work will be supervised by the State High way Department, with the State and the Town each bearing one-half the cost. It is understood that all rights o f way have been secured, and that the State will offer the sidewalk projects immediately for bids, and that actual work will begin with the hope of com pletion before winter weather.

A. Burke, covering operation of the schools for the ses sion of 1951-52. It should be of in terest to all citizens. The estimated value of school sites, buildings, furniture and fix tures, and school buses excluding the new Carver-Price High School Building which was not in operation during the last session, was 785,- 450.00. The total enrollment for all the schools of the County was 2,133. Out of this number, 1,920 children attended school every day. A total of 213 children were absent each day, eithsfrom sickness-or other causes. This number of absentees represents a definite loss to the pupils and also to the County. Un fortunately, many causes of absences did not come under the head of ex cusable absences. Of the 2,133 enrolled, 1,820 pass ed their grades, 225 were retained in the same grades and 88 pupils dropped out of school entirely.
