Trent, of Appomat tox, was much enjoyed and we feel the community as weH as the church was benefited by the sermons so ably delivered. An Epworth League has re cently been organized at Trinity church which we hope will be a great help to the community. Mr. T. M. Martin accompan ied some of his friends to Nor folk last week-end. Mr. Milton Isbell looks quite sporty driving around in his new Dodge. There will be a lawn party at Trinity church Saturday, August 18th, beginning at 5 oclock. Dont forget the date.

The ability to tell a good story well is without question an incom parable social asset. Such talent is the undisputed possession of D . D.

According to the Arabian Knights, ability to tell the worlds longest story is said to have saved the life of Queen Scheherazade, whose task was just about as difficult as her name. Genial Mr.Isbell would not think of trying to capture the royal I- dys crown for extended anecdote, lie prefers rather to encompass a great deal of significence in few words. In a world of rather serious outlook, especially at this time Mr. Isbell is performing a real service for humanity in his ability to make foiks smile, His motto, as you may well .surmise is Laugh and the world laughts with you.

Refreshments were served and many goods were be sold at auction. - Every one eemed to be in a good humor and Jhe day seemed destined to pass off -fith success and profit. But, un- 1 ortunately for our law-abiding col- i red citizens many of the young qnen of that race imbibed too freely 4n the morning, and, feeling pretty jolly, determined on making the fair at Galilee a vent for their serperflu- ous mirth. So, in a crowd, they re sorted thither. The exercises had commenced, as near as we can learn, abont 1 1 oclock, and the young men arrived about a half hour after that time. As soon as they reached the scene of festivities they began picking fusses with those present, and try ing in every way to disturb the peace. From small beginnings the trouble gradually increased until it grew into a general scrimmage. Indeed it was hard to tell who was impli cated aud who was not. Rocks were thrown at the church and several pistols were fired. 1 Women rushed from the building and for a time it seemed as if pandemonium was turn ed loose. The main ring-leaders seem to have been, Albert Walker, Doug Watkins, Chas. Sears, Samuel Johns, Jr., Alex. Christian, John McReynolds, Jesse Turner and Har vey Coleman. , Warrants were issued for the ar rest of the above, and on Tuesday, they were brought before Justice of the Peace Durrum. The firstprisoner tried was Chas. Wright but as there was au insufficiency of evidence, he was released. v He fired a pistol, it is true, but apparently did it out of a spirit of fun and not with any evil intent. Albert Walker was the next pris oner called, and from the evidence deduced he was evidently very nnjcb concerned in the disorderly proceed ings. Albert seems to have been partic ularly conspicuou s in starting the row. As one of the witnesses said, Al bert was exposed dat away any how, an as he was pretty high up he couldnt bate him down. Several of the men had been en deavoring to throw Sam Johns down upon the benches, but had not suc- ueeded, when Albert, rushing up, seized Sam threw him down and ex claimed, no mattah how long de legs is, devse boun to come wheu Im thar. Doug Watsons chief offense was thiowing rocks inside the church. He rushed in at the door with a handful of rocks and without hesitat ing let them fly at the assembled crowd. He threw three timeB and twice his aim proved true, falling with dire, effect upon the heads of two young men. Some say that Doug repeated this outrage, hut it was not introduced into the evidence. The only personal difficulty that occurred was between Archer Wal ker and Charlie Sears. The former claims that Sears struck him on the head with a rock and for that reason he pommelled him with a stick. Sears, however, reached for another rock and soon had Uncle Archer in full flight for the church, where, by the aid of several of the women, he was concealed beneath a staircase until the fracas had subsided. Some evidence was introduced tending to show that Sears was first struck by Walker but, in spite of that, it is generally believed that he Sears was one of the prime causes of the whole disturbance. Samuel Johns, Jr., when brought up for trial, was shown to have been j ust as guilty as any of them. His brother, Lawson Isbell, did all in his power to restrain him but to no pur pose. The evidence of Lawson Isbell against his own brother was surpris ingly intelligent, being clear, logical and honest. Alex. Christian seems to have ren dered himself surprisingly obnoxious. As one of the wituesses testified be made everything all into a gangle. The difficulty must have lasted about five hours, and how the re spectable and law-abiding colored people could have submitted to it as long as they did, is Something as tonishing. We are told that this sort of thing has been going on for seven or eight years, and that finally it became so unbearable that the members of Galilee Church were forced to have recourse to the law. The action of the witnesses and of those who caused the arrest is highly commendable, and should be met with hearty approbation from every white man in the county.
