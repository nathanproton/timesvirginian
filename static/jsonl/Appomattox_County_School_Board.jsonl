Approval to build the school was given by the super visors on February 9, 1968. The approved resolution pro vides a way by which a locality may borrow money at a rate cheaper than funds can be ob tained on the open market. The School Board drew up the resolution in a called meet ing on Thursday evening, Dec. 9. According to Supt. Earl J. Smith, the action by the super visors will also mean that Ap pomattox is eligible to obtain 500,000 in vocational funds to assist in the construction of a vocational-agriculture b u il d - ing. He said, further,  Wehave been assured that funds will be available for a school here if commitments are made to begin construction by July of 1972. Plans for the new school are complete and have been approv ed by the State Board of Educa tion. AiYti.xiai funds for the school, estimated to cost about 3 million, will be obtained through a Literary Fund loan of 500,000, also a low-interest 3 source of funds for school construction. Supervisor John C. Cole ask ed the Supt. if the costs of the school are definitely set .  We do not want to put our selves in the position of an escalating situation, Cole said. Supt. Smith said that he feels that the figures given for con struction are sound ones. The Supt. thanked the board for its action and added, 1 have enough faith in Appomattox county to feel that this new school will lead to a better community. Welfare Dept. Supervisors also announced the appointment of Mrs. B. G. Anderson EUa to the Appomat tox County Welfare Board.
