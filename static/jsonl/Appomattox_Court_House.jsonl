Post Office at what is bow Appo mattox, Virginia. Information secured from Nation al Archives and the Post Office De partment, Washington, D. C., tells an interesting story of a full cen tury of mail service here. There have been 20 postmaster andor acting postmaster ap pointments in the 100 years of operation and the incumbent, E. LeRoy Smith, has served longer than any other. The name of the office has been changed several times. On February 23, 1855, a fourth class post office was established here and was call ed Nebraska, Virginia. The first postmaster was Samuel D. McDear- mon. Salary amounted to 6.01. The office operated under the name of Nebraska, Virginia until September 21, 1894, when it was changed to Appomattox. However, due to confusion with the Old Ap pomattox Court House community, the \u00f1am\u00e9 of the post office here changed on January 15, 189 to West Appomattox, Virginia. It oper ated under that name until June 27, 1906, when it took the present name of Appomattox, Virginia. The office became third class in 1909 and second class in 1987. In mid-1955 it is scheduled to become first class, due to volume of busi ness. Several years ago it became first class, but reverted to second class due to a shift in parcel post business. The following is a list of post masters and their terms Samuel D. MeDearmon, February 23, 1855 Richard H, Mavin, December 31. 1855 Robert I, Boaz, October 4, 1866 Thomas E.

Harwood, Acting Poet- master, May 15, 7931 Joseph E. Dinwiddle, June 1, 1982 E. LeRoy Smith, Acting Poet- master, June 1, 1034 Regular Appointment, March 8, 1936. However, this was not the first pqst. office in what is now Appomat tox County, Tie following inform ation  supplied by the National Archives and reports of the Post Office Department Appomattox County, Virginia The records show that this office was established on April 1, 1811, under the name of Floods, Buckings ham County, Virginia, with Thomas Trent the first postmaster. It is shown that the name oi the county was changed to Prince Edward on March 22, 1837, that the name of the office was changed to Clover Hill on July 7, 1837 and that the county in which the office was lo cated was changed to Appomattox sometime between September 23, 1845 and June 30, 1849. The re cords show that the name of the office was changed to Appomattox Court House on February 3, 1859 and changed to Appomattox on July 3, 1892.  It therefore appears that the his tory of a post office at what is now without a post office but known as Old Appomattox Court House, is equally interesting. That part of the county was in Buckingham when the post office was established as Floods in 1811. Later it became a part of Prince Edward and finally Appo mattox in 1845. Shortly after the burning of the court house in 1892, the court house was rebuilt at what is now the Town of Appomattox, and final ly the post office at the historic old village was discontinued. It was of ficially Appomattox Court House, Virginia, at the time Gen. Lee sur rendered to Gen. Grant. Undocumented stories often told here relate that in the gold rush days a hundred years and more ago?- some family started out for Ne braska, got this far and liked the place so much that they decided to settle here and call this Nebraska.

It appears that Tucker was slain on the back porch of the residence in Evergreen in which he and his wife, her mother, and her brother, May berry lived. This shooting apparently occurred sometime after 10 oclock Friday night. Called to the scene from his home in Appomattox, Dr. Christian was on an errand of mercy. From a re construction of the events, it appears that the popular young doctor was shot as he approached the door of the -house. Christians body was found on the walk to the house, and removed only after a terriffic gun battle between the posse and Mayberry. Nearly two hours passed between the shooting of Tucker and the flni arrest, of May- berry- Mayberry was Yelled by a shotgun blast near a garage hide out from which he had fired from 30 to 50 shots from a pistol and a shotgun at the surrounding officers. Mayberry was given medical treat ment here and sent to Rlctnond Saturday morning. His wounds are said not to be serious. The midnight sounding of sirens and the use oi flares to light up the scene attracted the attention of a sizeable gathering of spectators and details of the tragedy have been the topic of interest here since.

They never dreamed that the Tavern they built at Clover Hill, in 1819, would become the museum of relics of a great peace for a nation re united after four years of bitter internacine war. Clover Hill Tavern is the oldest building at the Appomattox Court House National Military Park. It has just been restored and houses the National Park Service Museum . . . a museum now displaying as a late addition the famous Guillaume paint ing of the Surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee to Gen. U. S. Grant, April 7, 1865. Another new feature is an electric map, showing just where the great events of history occured here. Two brothers, Alexander and Lil bourne Patteson, opened a stage coach line from Lynchburg to Rich mond in 1811. At that time the im mediate area at what is now Old Appomattox Court House was a part of Prince Edward County, Appomat tox County not having been estab lished until 1845. In 1814 the Pat teson brothers purchased 206 acres laying near the north branch of the Appomattox River from one John B. Sadler. The land was valued at 157.89. In 1819 they built the Clover Hill Tavern, and the property zoomed to a value of 7,890. There is quite a story about these Patteson -brothers. A 208 page In formal History of the Virginia-Ken- tucky Pattesong in Illinois, Their Forbears and Their Kin by Ethel Marion Smith, traces the Patteson ancestry back to 1680. The first Pat teson entry in St. Peters Parish Reg ister in Eastern Virginia, shows that one Thomas Patteson came over from England in 1680 and settled on what is known as Roxbury Plan tation. Thomas Patteson had five sons Thomas, Edward, David, Alex ander and Geofrge, The next name to look for was Obfcdiah Patteson, who the St. Peters Parish Register says was born in 1750. His second son was named Littleberry . . . and father and son, Obediah and Little- berry took up land patents in this section in 1782. Records exist that show! that Obediah Patteson paid taxes on 800 acres of land in Camp bell County from 1782 through 1791. Littleberry Patteson was born in New Kent County in February, 1754, married in 1782 and died June 23, 1827. He fought in the Revo lutionary War. He is known to have paid taxes on land in Buckingham County from 1793 to 1814. He married Matilda Smith. Lilbourne and Alexander, build ers of Clover Hill Tavern, were sons of Littleberry Patteson. They owned Clover Hill Plantation, under a deed dated November 25, 1814. Alexander Patteson died in 1836, and his fam ily moved to Kentucky. Family rec ords show that the family was prom- ient. David Patteson of Chesterfield, Jonathan of Lunenburg, and Charles of Buckingham represented their re spective counties in the Virginia Convention of 1788 to ratify the United States Constitution. A stage coach line was a great thing 150 years ago. Clover Hill Tavern was a grand conception at a time when Americans were fan ning out from the Atlantic Coast and moving Westward. The Clover Hill Tavern remained in the hands of the Patteson family until Aug ust 8, 1839, when it passed to John Raine. It was transferred to Hugh Raine in 1842 for the sum of 3,- 200, and again passed to Samuel McDearmon in 1845. McDearmon, a great leader in the early growth of this section and one of the top citizens of his time, added many outbuildings and improvements to the Tavern. However, he sold the property to Samuel Glover in 1854. The foundation lines of this store are today readily apparent as a de pression in the ground between the Tavern and the Ferguson home, re cently used as Park Service office. About the year 1859, Glover transferred his holdings to Wilson Hix. The holdings at that time con sisted of lots 16 and 17 in the vil lage of Appomattox Court House and contained the Tavern and its outbuildings. Hix operated the prop erty as a hotel all through the Civil War period. It was yvritten up in the New York Hearld in April, 1865. It was referred to as Glenns Hotel and was used as the office of the paroling officer. Gen. Sharpe. In 1880, it was transferred from the estate of Wilson Hix to Edward G. Hix and included lots 11, 17, 18 and part of lot 16 in the village. The ownership continued to change hands until finally resting in the Continued on Page Eight"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Court", "House"], "snippet": "oldest building at the <mark>Appomattox</mark> <mark>Court</mark> <mark>House</mark> National Military Park.

We the Democra tic. County Committee, therefore address this appeal to the Democratic voters of the county. The Democratic Party is in power in the Nation, State and County. By reason of the splendid and patriotic administration of President Wilson it is likely to re main in power in the nation for years to come. By reason of its splendid administration in State affairs for many years, its lease on power in the State of Virgina is indefinite. No less indefinite is the control of Appomattox County by that Party, because its control has enured -to the benefit of the people and the upbuilding of the county. Since 1902 there has been no serious opposition to the Democratic party in tjhis county and the result has been a great development in our county along all lines. Ve notice published in the Times-Virginian, a call is made by Dr. D. Mott Robertson inviting the people to attend a meeting at Appomattox Court House on Friday, August 20th, for the pur pose of nominating a full ticket in opposition to the ticket nominated in the Democratic primary. This movement purports to be by independents but from the personnel of the leaders it smacks of Republicanism. The call invites all voters of the county to attend who believe in low taxes the election of Dis trict School superintendents and school trustees by the people who are opposed to the issuing of county bonds and who favor the one-room schools having as long session as the other schools. These are general propositions, without details of how their accomplishment can be brought about, and probably many of the voters are in favor ,of one or more of them. Certainly everybody is in favor of a lower tax rate if the governmental affairs can be run on such a rate without seriously impairing the progress of the State or County. Many of our citizens are in favor of election of district school superintendents and school trus tees by the people, and we have no doubt if a sufficient number of citizens would so petition, the re presentative ot this county would introduce in the Legislature an amendment to the Constitution providng for the election of district school superintendents by the people, and upon a similar petition would introduce a bil in the legislature providing for the election of school trustees by the people. There is no question before the people as to the issue of county bonds as there is no need for or demand for such an issue in bur county. We have no doubt every citizen of Appomattox would be in favor of the one-room schools having as long sessions as the other schools of the county if that could be done without increasing the rate of taxation or reducing the length of session of the other schools. The call is inconsistent in that on one hand he advocates lower taxation and on the other a larger expenditure for school purposes. You may get one but you cannot get both you cant have longer school sessions without paying an additional amount of money for them and this money comes in the shape of taxes from the people. Our Democratic Nominees will go before the voters at the November election upon their re cords with the belief that the masses of the people, who think at all, have approved and will ratify their policy by reelecting them. Neither will the voters be misled by any insinuations and fault-find ing proclamations, of that coterie of citizens who are out of office, and public favor, and who are seek ing an issue upon which to get in. We appeal to the Democrats and the thoughtful independent voters not to allow the Republican leaders of the county and a lew disappointed Democrats to lead them into the Republican party."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Court", "House"], "snippet": "attend a meeting at <mark>Appomattox</mark> <mark>Court</mark> <mark>House</mark> on Friday, August 20th,"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Court", "House"], "snippet": "attend a meeting at <mark>Appomattox</mark> <mark>Court</mark> <mark>House</mark> on Friday, August 20th,"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Work has just been finished on a project of unusual interest that was undertaken by the War Department some months ago, involving  the marking of the important spots at aud around old Appomattox Court House connected with the surrender of Lee to Grant in 1865. During thp early summer it was suggested to Secretary Lamont. by Mr. Kirkley, one of the members of the board hav ing in charge the publication of the records of the rebellion, that it was time now to mark these spots if it was ever to be done, as the land marks are fast being obliterated by the passage of years. The Sec retary saw the importance of this and immediately gav\u00e9 orderk to have the idea carried out. Since then Jtfajor Davis, the head of  the board, has been working hard, and has at last succeeded in having all th\u00e9 points pf interest at Appomattox marked in a permanent manner. This is done by means of cast-iron tablets that afe fastened to iron posts five feet long. They are sunk into the ground a sufficient depth to secure stability, and bear the tablets, which are about three feet long by two high, in a slanting position, on a line with the eye.. The letters are two and a quarter inches high and stand oat in good relief so that they can be read some distance Off. A contrast in black and white paint gives them great legibility. The tablets start at the station where the new courthouse is now lo cated. There they are merely sign boards with arrows pointing in the direction of the old courthouse, which stood about three miles from the railroad. The road that con nects i t with the station is the Lynchburg turnpike, and-runs in a generally northerly direction from the station. The troops of each side were encamped on both sides of the road. The preliminary tablets merely -direct th\u00e8 visitor to the courthouse. About half way to the site of the surrender is the first marking tablet, announcing  On this spot, were established the headquarters, of  Lieutenant-General Ulysses- S. Grant, U. 8. A., on the afternoon of ApriF9, 1865. The next in order along the road is the most interesting,reading thus  This tablet marks the site of the house owned and occupied by Wilmer McLean, in which General U. S. Grant, U. 8. A , and General Robert E. Lee. C. S. A., met and agreed upon the terms of surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, on the afternopn, of Sunday, April 9, 1865. The honse was taken down anil re moved. to Washington, D. C., in 1893. There-is a carious anachronism in this tablet that will be rectified later.- When the McLean house was taken down it was thought that it, would be taken to Chicago, but the plan of the syndicate that purchased the en tire site of the surrender was changed and it was decided to remove the building to Washington. Up to date, however, the material has not been removed, though the house has been taken down. .Thus the tablet is. not quite correct, but. if the material is not taken away soon a new tablet will b\u00e9 cast that will be acurate.  Pi -v . ? i, m A few rods further up the road the visitor comes upon thesite of the old courthouse, the story of which is told in the third tablet, thus  Here stood Appomattox Court House  built 1842  burned 1892. The ruins of the old building are still to be seen. On the morning following the meeting between the generals in the McLean house, both of them started out from their respective headquar ters and rode on horseback down the side of the road, which was very muddy, for thejurpose of a further I interview. They met about half way, at a spot a little north of the court house, on the west side of the road. Here is a tablet erected to this effect  On this spot Lieuienent-General Ulysses 8. Grant, U. S. A., and Gen eral Robert E. Lee, C. 8. A., met on the morning of April 10, 1865. Then the lines of both sides are marked. The line of Union on tposts on the morning of Sunday, April 9, crossed the road just beyond the meeting place, and that of the Con federate outposts is noted about 200 yards furthur on. The surrender was consummated by the Confederate troops marching down toward the South, from their encampment up the road and passed"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Court", "House"], "snippet": "at aud around old <mark>Appomattox</mark> <mark>Court</mark> <mark>House</mark> connected with the surrender"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Court", "House"], "snippet": "at aud around old <mark>Appomattox</mark> <mark>Court</mark> <mark>House</mark> connected with the surrender"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
