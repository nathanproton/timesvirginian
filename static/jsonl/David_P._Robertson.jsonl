Party Organization. Much Enthusiasm. Large Attend ance. Pursuant to a call of Dr. D. M. Robertson, Chairman, of the Citizens Party a large and enthusiastic meeting of citi zens assembled in mass meet ing at the Courthouse here Fri day and adopted a platform of principles and practically put a full tioket in the field for all County and District1 officers in opposition to the nominees of the Democratio party. Every seat in the Courthouse was oc cupied and m an were stand ing in the aisles. The crowd was estimated at 200.  Many of these, however, were specta tors, and not in sympathy with the movement. Dr. L. M. Robertson, Chair man, appointedthe following Committee on Resolutions J. W. Cawthorn Jr., R. S. Jen kins, David Alvis, E. F. Col- lips, S. P. Coleman and J. T. jGotas. While the committee was out J. P. L. Fleshman addressed the meeting. Mr. Fleshman has been a Republican for many years his remarks were direct ed against the office-holders of Appqmattox County, particu larly for raising the assessed values and the rate of taxation he referred to a notice posted by the Superintendent of Schools, 1800 for schools and 1700 for incidentals. He wanted the receipts and dis bursements published of the school fund, also the road fund and the Supervisors proceed ings. He wants Appomattox to sell her poor houses and pay her debts, two poor houses and three paupers is too expensive, he deolared. He opposed a bond issue, saying it would make slaves of the people. The Committee on Resolu tions then made its report and the chair requested J.- W. Caw- thon, the Chairman, to ex- lain to the meeting the reso- utions they were unanimously adopted. We, the citizens of Appomat tox County in mass-meeting assembled at the Courthouse of said county on this the 20th day of August, 1915 desirous of promoting our own welfare and that of every other - citizen of our county do make the fol lowing declaration of princi ples and for the support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our influence and our votes. We demand a more economi cal administration of our State and county affairs, and that all taxes and licenses be eq a- ized as nearly as possible and that the poll tax be made col lectible as other taxes and abolished as a prequisite to voting. We demand the repeal of the aw appointing the  board of review to do over the work al ready performed by the -con? missioners of the revenue, as this is a useless waste of money and very objectionable to the people.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.
