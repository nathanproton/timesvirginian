Usually the most produc tive fields are in tbe allnvinl lands along streams. This Is particularly true of Central New York, where the valleys nfford the best conditions for crops. The streams In these vallpys are tor rents In spring when tbe soil Is most easily washed, and It has often hap pened that through the changing of the course of a stream a fertile field Is ruined, nor is the abandoned stream bed reclaimed without great labor. Such loss of land can be prevented to a great extent by the proper use of willows upon the banks. Willows have a natural affinity for stream banks. They do little damage to adjacent fields, since their shade Is not intense tlielr root system is deep In the soil and some species by tlielr peculiar habits draw their water mainly from the streams. Their root system Is very unusual. It forms n dense and ex tensive mass just at the waters edge, and no matter how deeply submerged or how much washed, the tree remains securely anchored and thrives. An other advantage which willows possess over most trees Is the rapidity with which they grow. Venerable looking willows are often yoqng- Willows are easily planted. A branch of any size put Into a stake and driven Into the ground, in the spring or fall, will root and grow rapidly. Willows with fragile twigs propagate them selves In much the same way. The best species to plant for this purpose Is Sallx albl or some of its several varieties. It forms the most compact and extensive root masses and grows In any soil. Other species will serve tho purpose, especially tbe rbcr 84  9 st species, but ns a retainer of stream banks the white willow is the most efficient.American Agriculturist."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["white"], "snippet": "of stream banks the <mark>white</mark> willow is the most"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["white"], "snippet": "of stream banks the <mark>white</mark> willow is the most"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Or just the family? In any event youll want a Christmasy look ing table and it can be accomplished easily and inexpensively. Here are three suggestions A large bowl, preferably of wood and filled with shining fruits a bunch of grapes on top gives a festive air. You can lay a wreath of holly about the bowl and use tall, slender candles grouped about it. Lace runners or doilies that reveal the gleaming table top complete this informal picture. r . For an all-white table, use a white table cloth for your background and a miniature Christmas tree in the center. For ends of the table, white tapers in candelabra are excellent, and around their bases use simulat ed snow, cotton sprinkled with tin sel. Flowers, while more expensive, make a beautiful table.

Is there doubt of your being able to take the Indian Chief Into port? Why do you ask? Becausewell, I have heard things not much, but-enough to arouse suspi cion. Then you had some trouble just now, and locked a man up ln one of the staterooms. It was to ask you about this that I came on deck. Who was the man, and what had he done? Our old friend, Fergus McCann, I answered, deciding to be frank with her. It was not so much what he had done, as what he proposed doing. He was attempting tp corrupt the crew forward by the use of money, nnd un fortunately, there are some scamps aboard only too willing to make trouble. I felt It safer to nip the scheme early. But whatwhat does Mr. McCann seek? Why should he endeavor to buy up the men? What is his purpose? To have the Indian Chief returned to an American port. Ill do him the credit of saying that, until I told him a while ago, he possessed no knowledge whatever that Bascom owned the vessel, or was on board. He hates Bascom yet, and will be onty too glad to ruin him. And he hates me, because of what occurred ln the boat. This Is what underlies his action, no doubt then he believes money will ac complish anything, and he has found saiiormen forward ready enough to do the dirty work, If he will only pay well for It. Tou know them? The two most prominent are Jim White nnd a fellow known aboard as Liverpool Red, both typical forecastle bullies. I know how to deal with their sort. Youyou have decided what to do, then? I have decided to fight It out, at least I gave you my promise, Miss Vera, to take this ship to Hamburg if It was possible to get there. And there is no other way of saving the investment In this vesstfl and cargo? I know of none. Then we must go on, must we not? Xi hope you will, Captain Hollts, Before I could stop her, or add an other word, she was gone, and I was apparently alone on deck. I remained on deck the greater part of the night, but nothing of an alarm Ing nature took place. .The crew re mained quiet, nnd the watch on duty Obeyed orders promptly enough to give those of us aft a new feeling of confidence. The sky cleared, although the wind remained fresh and the sea heavy enough to keep two men at the wheel. The Indian Chief made good weather of it, however, and I possessed faith In Lenyords seamanship. For an hour, perhaps, I loitered about on deck, but all remained so quiet that finally, with a word to the mate to have me called at the slightest sign of need, I went be low, and turned la. I did not remove my clothes, and the new day was barely reddening the east when I was aroused Jiy a trampling of feet on the deck overhead. There was no call, and I was sailor enough to comprehend what was going on above __ the watch was about to be changed, and Lenyord was using all hands ln cleaning ship. The activity, the Quietly spoken orders, the low chant of a song as the men tolled at a rope, were evidence that my presence was not required, and I felt it would please both officers to be left alone ln charge. I opened the port and looked out at the glorlotis morning. It was a lonely ocean scene, yet wildly beau tiful. Everywhere was the wild deso lation of the sea, nothing on which the eye could rest except the restless waves, the constant shifting of colors. Satisfied that no other vessel was with in range of vision, I lay down again. I do not recall a pleasanter meal at sea than our breakfast that morning. All were in excellent humor, and no premonition of trouble entered our minds. The night had passed-quietly both officers reporting the crew docU and cheerful. Olson was on watch, but Masters joined us at table, and repotted all weU In the engine room, and together we"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["White"], "snippet": "most prominent are Jim <mark>White</mark> nnd a fellow known"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["White"], "snippet": "most prominent are Jim <mark>White</mark> nnd a fellow known"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Lon Swarton did not return to the June house. Some one said he had gone away. Mr. June was not aware of the quarrel, nor did he know that his daughter was dally meeting the man he disliked.

It was settled that she was to steal away from the house at night and meet her lover at the corner beyond the es tate. Wilfred arranged everything for her.

She had been obliged to turn off the .-Ide-tloor con nectlon with the Burglar alarm, and the heavy door swung back noiselessly and let her out into the garden.

Fifteen minutes passed, and still Eva waited she was becoming nerv oils and uncomfortable. Another fifteen minutes, and no one came. The wretched -girl was afraid to stay ion. er there were tears in her eyes and she was trembling violently. Something must have happened, she thought hut what shall I do? I cannot get into the house without a key. and I cannot stay here. Slowly she retraced her steps at last,J feeling more secure in the shadow of her home. At the side door she paused and sat down on the broad upper step leaning backward she was surprised to feel her support giving way, and then the door swung slowly inward. Thinking that she had neglected to close it firmly Eva slipped into the house, thankful for the opportunity, and was soon in her own room, deter mined never to repeat her folly.

Oh, no, she protested and Aleck knew she was sincere. So they pre pared to terminate their holidays by celebrating the wedding in the pine grove. Melanie spent the intervening days happily with Agatha, or walk ing with Aleck, or with the delightful group that foregathered in Parson Thayers library. Jimmy made ex travagant and highly colored verses to the bride-to-be, to Salile Kingsbury, and even to himself. His feet were often lam\u00e9, but he solemnly assured tbe company that it was entirely due to circumstances over which he had no control. A wedding was a wedding, said he, and should have its bard also its dancers and Its minstrels. Well have all our friends in Illon, anyway, said Aleck. They counted up the list. Besides the occupants of the house and those from the Hillside there would be Doctor Thayer, Susan Stoddard and Angie, Big, and Little Simon, and the lawyer. And theyre all going to dance with the bride, announced Jim, After me. Iin first choice. A dance led, so to speak, by the elusive Monsieur Chatelard? The name alone made jimmy wroth. Its a dance for which he will pay the fiddler yet! he prophesied, Oh, hes gone this time. Scared out of the country for keeps! was Alecks expressed opinion.

A wind from the sea flocks of white clouds scudding across the sapphire sky, and a sun allkind nesssuch was the day. It was never a weathpr breeder either but steady, promising good for the mor row. Many times during the week James and Chamberlain and Agatha had their heads together, planning sur prises for the bridal pair. The result was that on Tuesday Jim and Cham berlain borrowed the white motor-car, loaded it down with a large variety of junk, such as food from Bailies kitch en, flowers and so on, and started for CharlesporL They ran down to the wharf, transferred their loot to the rowboat, and pulled out to the Sea Gull, swinging at her mooring in deep water. A half-hour of work, and the yacht was dressed for festival. There were strings of flags to stretch from bow to masthead and to stern  pennants for topmasts the Stars and Stripes in beautiful silk for a standard, and gorgeous banner with an embroidered A and M intertwined, for special oc casions. Flowefs were placed in the cabins, and food in the lockers. The seamen had been aboard, made. the acht clean and shipshape as a war essel on parade, and had got per mission to leave for their last night ashore. Everything was in readiness, even to the laying of the fire in the engine hold. The bride and groom were to come aboard the next day about noon and cruise down the coast leisurely, weather permitted. Hand, in charge of the white motor-car, with Madame Reynier, Chamberlain, Agatha and Jimmy, were to start for New York, touring as long as their inclination lasted. The sophisticated Lizzie was to travel to what was, for ler, the center of the universe, by the fastest Pullman.
