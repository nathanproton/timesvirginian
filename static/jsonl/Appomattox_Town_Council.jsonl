The House Bill, which is co-sponsored by Congressmen Caldwell Butler and Robert Daniel would define navigable waters as contained in Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. That definition terma navigable waters aa those which are presently used, or are suscepti ble to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement aa a means to transport interstate com merce. Controversy began several months ago when the Corps of Engineers made public its intention to expand its jurisdic tion over every lake, stream, stock pond and irrigation ditch in the nation - - this being its definition of navigable wat ers. The Board of Supervisors of Appomattox County and the Appomattox Town Council in June at 1975 went on record as opposing the attempt to extend federal control over all waters within the town and county. Letters stating their opposition were written from the Town of Appomattox to U.8. Senators Harry F. Byrd and William Scott aad Congressman W. C. Dan Daniel 5th District.  Representative Dan Daniel hai warned that regulations proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expanding its authority over all water ways I the country would constitute land use planning by another name. According to the 5th District representative, under the poli cy any landowner wishing to build a structure that comes in contact with the water is required to get a permit from the Corps. Unless legislation now pending in Congress to alleviate the problem is passed, the Corps will soon need a bureocracy double its present size to fulfill the functions which it projects for itself. The Bedford County, Camp bell County, Amherst County, and Appomattox County Board of Supervisors, in addition to Appomattox Town Council and the Bedford City Council have all passed resolutions opposing the Corps expanded authority. The CVPDC also passed a similar resolution in May. At the Recommendation of the Smith Mountain-LeeaviUe Reservoirs Committee the Commission adopted the reso lution supporting the House Bill which would provide an acceptable definition of naviga ble waters to localities. In other action the Commis sion also passed a resolution opposing the changing of the effective date of the scheduled annual increase for General Registrars proposed by the State Board of Elections. According to Roy C. Mayo, HI, Amherst County Adminis trator and Chairman of the Commissions Governmental Administrators Technical Com mittee, the State Board of Elections wants to change the date of annual increases for General Registrars from July 1 to March 1. This change would create a great deal of confusion for localities since we use July 1 aa the standard date for salary increases for county and municipal employees. Budget ary complications will result if we have to work with both the July 1 and the March 1 dates, said Mayo. The resolution opposing the date change was passed unanimously by the Commis sion.
