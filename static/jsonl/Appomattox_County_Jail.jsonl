He complains about the debts we fowe for school buildings. The bool hoards of the County do owe ePLlterary Fund for money bor rowed to aid in building the Appo- mattox high school, the Stonewall high school, and the graded schools at Oakville, Tower Hill, Vera, and Pamplin, but they are paying what they owe as it falls due, and the in terest on what they owe, out of the school levy, and will continue to do so. We also owe the Literary Fund for part of the money necessary to build the dormitory at Appomattox but we borrowed tiffs money on 15 years time at 3 interest, and the small rental charged teachers t and scholars for rooms in this dormitory will pay the interest and retire the debt as jt matures. This is un doubtedly a good business proposi tion, but no sound business proposi tion ever penetrated the head of D. Mott Robertson. The Appomattox high school, in eluding grounds, building, and equipment, has cost not less than 30,000, over twice as much as the court-house and jail cost. The County of Appomattox has only subscribed 2,000 of this amount. The rest of it was given by the State subscribed by patriotic citizens, anc borrowed from the State. The original amount we borrowed to build this school was 7,500. The interest on this and 4,500 of the principal has been paid out of the school levy. Future interest and the other 3,000 will be paid in the same way. A safe business proposition oi! this kind in the interest of the children of Appomattox County does not appeal to D. Mott Robertson because he is opposed to the children of any part of the County havin the same advantages the children of other counties have at least, his letter justifies the conclusion that such is his opposition. We are for the schools, for good schools all over the County, and with the present rate of taxation, before many years roll around we will have good schools within the reach of every child in the County, . Dr. Robertson alludes with much bombast to the time when he was Treasurer, as if he ran the whole business. We know that the Boar of Supervisors to which he refers Messrs. Ligon, Thornhill, and Jones were .capable and honest officials and progressive men, and un doubtedly would have done more for the development of the County if Dr. Robertson had promptly paid over the taxes he collected.

Why the good people of Virginia will permit these hells on earth to exist in an enlight ened community, a community where churches and preachers and Christians are plentiful, is a mytery indeed.

Why will the good people of the state shut their eyes to these things and fail to see them? Gan they thus escape responsibility?  Staunton Dispatch.

A feature-packed se quence of well-planned and staged event will attract large crowds to historic Old Appomattox Court House, for what is a major program of the Appomattox County James town Festival Year Committee. Bo dominant in Tibs Appomat tox Story is the theme of Christ ian Peace, as exemplified here on April 9, 1865, that the Committee has set up as the first event of Ap pomattox Oounty Day a county-wide Religious Service. If there is any thing at all that Appomattox has. to make it stand out above every other town and city, it is the saga of a near century of Peace follow ing the episode of .Palm Sunday,. 1865. To focus attention, to that Christian Concept, a .Union. Religious Service will be held, outdoors, at the McLean House, at 1146 A, M. this Sunday. To plan and eet up such a tre mendous event, the Oounty James town Festival Committee, was for tunate in having Mrs. Frank F. Gairr accept general1 chairmanship. An outstanding leader in Virginia and1 national civic enterprises, Mrs. Carr has done a yeoman job in planning Appomattox County Day. She has received widespread co operation., and some 28 different clubs and organizations have been assigned activities for the day. Dr. Twjnman Williams, noted Presbyterian minister and historian, will bring the sermon at 1145. A number of churches ate moving up their own morning worship services to 1045, so as to enable their con gregation to attend1 the Union serv ice at the Old Court House. Senator C, T. Mosee heads the committee of uehem. Loud speak- era will be set up, and an. organ provided. Special music will be provided by a group choir, Mrs. E. Carter Martin, and Mr. E. Bruce Knapp. Mre. Murrell Ferguson will be organist. Dr. C. A. Ofellina and Pastor W. P. Lawrence, will assist in the service, j Chairs will be bet up under the trees for the- congregation. The service will last one hour. Immediately after the service, Circle No. 3 of the W. S. C. S. of Memorial Methodist Church, will sell lunches.

National Park Service personnel will cooperate in caring .for those present. One civic group has volun teered to do a Clean-Up job at the end of the days events. It is the hope of the Committee that Appomattox County Day may become an annual occasion, with a reliious service on World Peace as a regular feature. The plan is to continue such a service through 1665, the 106th annivearwary of the Peace made here by Lee and Grant. As the sacred rendezvous for the theme of Peace, Appomattox hopes that the public will support the varied events set for this Sunday. It is known that many from other areas plan to visit Appomattox this Sunday.

He went after them, following them into the house, and up the steps.

When the con vention was asked to meet in Richmond two years hense the objection was raised that at least 5,000 persons would attend, and Richmond did nht have adequate ho tel accommodations. But Mr. Joseph Bryan, who presented the invitation, pledged himself to see that the accom modations were adequate.

It has been some months since there has been a steamer running on the Appomat tox River. Because of the purity crusade now in progress in Richmond a tobacco company is in a quandarjr as to what to do with hangers advertising a new brand of smoking tobacco. They represent a shapely girl clad in tights, who hangs by her knees from a trapeze, smoking a ciagarette and holding a bag of the new tobacco in her hand. When a salesman started to put up these hangers he was stopped by a policeman, who warned him to desist until he had seen the Mayor. The latter sent him to the Chief of Po- liec, who in turn passed his along to the police justice, who advised him not to put them up. The proprietor of the Richmond Art Club, on appeal from the Police Court, was fined 25 and sentenced to an hour in jail. The club was convicted ip the Hustings Court of displaying improper pictures. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court. Among the pictures pronounced improper were some by Sir Frederick Leighton, Raphael and To- jetti. James W.

Feature events brought a steady flow of local and visiting people to the Old Court House all day. Some, 900 were present for the highly successful and inspiring re ligious service at 1145 A. M. Dr. W. Twyman Williams brought a brilliant sermon on the theme The Certainty of World Peace. LocOl Churches cooperated in this union service, and the general sen timent was there should be an an na! service of this type at the spot where the nation made Peace  in 1865. Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon, a highly successful Flow er Show was staged by the Garden C.ub. An Art Exhibit, an Antdqpe Firearms Exhibit, and a Militaiy Retreat at 5.00 P. M. with other successful events of the -day. Over two dozen local organiza tions participated in the planning and staging of Appiniatfax Coun- ty Day. Mrs. Frank F. Carr was Chairman for the entire event, with Ctiivin Robinson as Chairman of the County Jamestown Festival r ear Committee. The event was a home-coming oc casion, as many former residents of the county returned to spend the day at the Old Court House. Lunch was served on the grounds by the ladies of Circle 3 of Memorial Methodist Church. , A top feature of the day was Jne presence, in full costume, of parts of two companies of the re- actived Confederate Companies in Virginia. Their ladies, in period cos- tume, were also present. Tbey at tended the Union Religious Service and participated in the Military Re treat and other activities during the day.

County Government - At its March meeting, the Appomat tox County Board of Supervi sors decided- to apply for a 125,000 federal grant that would help construct a new jail for the county. At its May meeting, the board withdrew its application for the federal grant even though the existing facility was top on the list of jails-not up to state standards. The State Boaii of Correc tions closed the jail in mid-September after tne state fire marshall said it did not comply with state standards, and currently the prisoners are being transported to the jail in Charlotte County, quite an expense to the couaty, accord ing to board members. The board is still looking for a less expensive way to construct a new jail that will meet the. basic state requirements. They voted in November to accept bids for the proposed 5,400 square foot facility. Bids should be received in April for the facility and it coula cost in excess of 2361,000.

A gentleman un .Main street noti fied the officer that Jesse E. Routen was endeavoring to pass a cheek pur porting to be signed by Mr. T. Ash by Walts, which lie thought was a forgery. A close watch was kept over Routen for a short time and the officer accosted him and demanded the check. Routen declared that lie did not have a check. The.officer was now positive that he did have the instrument and told him if lie did not produce it he would have to lock him up. Routen pleaded that the nippers be not put on him, prom ising to accompany the officer with out trouble. He said he did not want to attract attention on the streets. Mr. Glanner, having just gone off duty for the day, did not have his club with him, and the pair started up Ninth street for the po lice headquarters. Knowing that if the man did not have the check, the officer kept a close watch on him in order to detect any effort to dispose of the evidence that would be strong against him if found on his person. All went well until Church street was passed when about half way up the steps to Court street Mr. Gluun- er saw Routen place a piece of paper in his mouth. Quick as a flash he designed the purpose of the prisoner. He did not have long to go over the situation until the check would have been swallowed, and with it would have disappeared any evidence that he might have against Routen. Without the slightest hesitation the officer pounced on his unsuspecting prisoner and began to choke him iu order to prevent him from destroy ing the check. Routen is a power ful man, but the strength and agili ty of the officer was too much for him. In less time than is required to relate the incident, the tongue of the man popped out his mouth, which was uow wide opeu in his fran tic efforts, to regain his breath. With Routen leaning over the rail at the side of the steps, it was now an easy matter for the officer to insert the fingers of his other hand and remove therefrom the check, damp and somewhat dilapidated for its experi ence, but still intact. About this tune Officers Metts and Harris ran up and the rest was easy. Routen was taken to the police head quarters, where formal charges were made against him, and later he was locked up at the city jail. Mr. Watts was seen yesterday even ing, and he stated that he had not, given the man a check. The instru ment was for 50 and was drawn on the National Exchange Bank. Routen endeavored to have the paper cashed at several stores, and also tried one or two persons on the streets in vain, the amount being too large for persons at that time of the day to cash, even if they were dis posed to do so. The scuffle between the officer and the prisoner drew a large crowd of persons who were eager to know what was the cause of the trouble, Routen comes of one of the high est bred families in Appomattox county lie is the only son of noble,, sainted and indulgent parents, who have gone to their reward. Of the immediate family only one daugh  ter, Mrs. Samuel Anderson, and Jesse remain. It is impossible for this young mans friends to account for his act, unless he did it in adit of desperation,caused by dissipation. Much sympathy aud sorrow is ex pressed for the young man here, where he nas many acquaintances and friends.

He sold-the property after the war to Mr. N. H. Ragland, of Richmond, who married an Appomattox lady, and merchandised in that county a number of years. He died a few years ago and the place was sold to the Surrender House and Museum Company, of Washington. The house was torn down preparatory to remov ing it to Washington, but for some reason it still remains there with a guard to watch over to keep off dep redators and relic-hunters. A little farther on stands a tablet marking the spot with the following inscription  On this spot stood the old court house of Appomattox county, erect ed in 1846 and destroyed by fire in 1892, All the county records were de stroyed in this fire, entailing such loss upon the people, in a pecuniary sense, that 1 fear it null be many years before they will Entirely reco ver, Just beyond the comity jail is sign hoard with the words, To the surrender grounds, and a few feet om it is a tablet with this inscrip tion  Near this spot was established the left flank of the first division of the Fifth Corps, of the Army of the Potomac, on the morning of Apr. 11,1865, to receive the arms of the infantry of the Army of Northern Virginia. Some two hundred yards down the road and about twenty yards to the right of it is a tablet with the- same inscription except it was the right flank instead of th\u00e9 left. Between these tw points the arms of the 9,000 faithful followers of General Lee were stacked. The writer of this article was one of the 9,000 that stacked his arms at this point, and he can well re member his humiliating feeling on April 11, 1865, when the Union army on each side of the road for half a mile or more, with banners flying, and as we poor rebs, as we were then called, marched between the two lines with arms reversed, our flags that had floated so often victoriously to the breeze forever furled, and with deep chagrin and mortification upon each countenance, we marched forward to this spot to stack arms, never again to be -taken up. What we then regarded as a great misfortune we now look upon as a blessing, Between these two points is the esidence of Mr. Geo. T. Peers, then and now the county clerk. From his back yard the last shot from the artillery of the army of Northern Virginia was fired, and a tablet marks the spot. A little further on another sign board shows where the Union outposts stood that morn ing. Not far from that one is an other tablet which reads  On this spot Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant and General R. E. Lee met on the morning of April the 10, 1865. About 200 yards down under tfie brow of the hill is a board showing the position of the Confederate out posts.

We hope to have all this done before the Centen nial, he said as he checked over a long list of projects. The Old! Court House is well underway, Steele said, with the village fenc ing almost complete. Both of these contracts were awarded J. E. Jamerson and Sons, local construction firm. He listed the rehabilitation and stabilization! of the old county jail as an important project. Ex plaining that the jail did not fig ure in the peace negotiations of 1865, nor the laying down of arms by Confederates, Steele said that nonetheless the old jail, constructed in the 1860s, holds much interest for visitors. The walls are very Strong, he said, and the structure has in teresting innovations to prevent escape. Those innovations in clude heavy iron bars, plus rings embedded in the floor of one cell to which prisoners might be shackled. Steele mentioned that the jail originally had a plaster ed interior. Plans are to retain one room of the jail in its pre sent condition to show the origi nal construction. New Entrance Road Preliminary drawings .have been completed, he said, for the new entrance road and parking area to be located about one- quarter of a mile west of the present road. After the new road and parking area is finish ed, which should be sometime in 64, he said, we will proceed with the restoration of the his toric Lynchburg - Richmond stage road. As a part of the plan to restore the old village to its 1865 appearance, all utility and power lines will be buried underground. We hope to achive a feeling of an historical village Steele said. Extensive archeological studies were made last year, he added, and we hope to complete the the three McLean House out buildings very soon. These in clude an ice house, slave quart ers, and kitchen. Mariah Wright House Funds have already been ap propriated for the restoration of the Mariah Wright house, Steele said. Congress also appropriated funds to include the construction of the Bocock-Isball stable. All of the Court House park restoration comes from an act of Congress, June 18, 1930, which provided 100,000 to commem- ororate the end of the War Be tween the States. Orginally slated to build a marble shaft to mark Lee and Grants historical meet ing, the 100,000 was eventually earmarked to preserve the old village and to restore original buildings which had been burned or torn down. Spearheading this movement were many Appomat tox citizens, including the Lynch burg Lions Club and the Appo mattox Chapter, United Dauglv ters of the Confederacy. In form er superintendent Hubert A. Gur neys history of the park, Gur ney writes Among the many individuals in Appomattox who joined in the movement to pro mote the Park project, we record the names of Miss M.

Its area is small and its people fewer than the average in the Southside counties. Located in the dark -tobacco belt, its money crop is tobacco, but corn, timber and dairy products are of consideration. Appomattox, the county seat is a tobacco market. The town has grown up near the Norfolk and Western Railway, three miles from tthe old Appo mattox Court House which has ceased to exist. The new courthouse is at the newer county seat, the countys larg est town. Aside from its own industrial and commercial in vests, Appomattox is a trad ing center for a considerable territory. Pamplin, a smaller town, has the distinction of being the home of the largest clay pipe kilns in the world. Tobacco reated the business, but the demand for this great nico tine absorber which excels al the meerschaums has kep these kilns for a good many years a flourishing industry. The daily output is  25,000 pipes. Three miles from the county seat lie some hundreds of ac res often spoken of as the Sur render Grounds To the Vir ginian, this is Appomattoxa name synonymous with the melting away of th\u00e9 last Gray army, -the return to d\u00e9vast\u00e9e farms, to ruined and desolate homes, to bereaved and sun dered families synonymous with the hopeless poverty of means to feed the hungry mouths of loved ones to fine provender few faithful teer vants who, like helpless child rc-n, were still their charge, synonymous with crushed ana bioken spirits, with Virginia desolation and despair.

The old Appomattox Court House was destroyed by fire in 1892 the McLean Housefor a long time the only note to 3often f,the somberness of the scenewas torn down for re moval to the Chicago Worlds Fair, but was never taken away. All that remains are some piles of rotting lumber and some bricks such as have remained intact one upon .an other in the walls. The old tavern, no longer a place of rest for the weary traveler journeying over the old stage road, still stands, but with the pathetic and desolate look of a place going to decay. The old jail is still there, but emp ty now. The place of the courthouse and the county seat have been moved over to the new town that has grown up three miles away. Years ago the Federal Government placed many markers t\u00fc guide the visitor to notable places on the Field. Many of these are gone the standards have de cayed and the njetal guides are halfburied in the ground, or repose in the gullies made by the washing rains.

Jones, commanding Com pany E , of the Seventy-first Regiment, prominent-in politics and business cir cles in Norfolk,-killed Maude Cameron, and then slashed his own throat at the the womans house. She went to Nor folk about a year ago, after graduation from a convent in Carolina. She met Jones, who became infatuated with her, and she returned his affection. Each, it is said, were intensely jealous of the other, and this jealousy caused the trag edy. Mr. John Johnson, an aged and re spected farmer of the Fork district, Warren county, was attacked on Main street, near Johnson Bros. confectionery store, by Janies E. Conner and cut in the neck, cheek and stomach, making three very serious wounds. Mr. John son was also hit across the head-by Ben jamin Sonner with a heavy club, which rendered his unconscious for a long time. There seems to have been a long-stand ing grudge between Johnson and Son ner. Johnson is being attended by Dr. M. L. Garrison. Both James E. Sonner and his son Benjamin were arrested. Mr. Johnsons condition is serious. Dorsey Mills, a young white man, aged about 23 , had his left foot crushed between the bumpers of two freight cars of a Southern Railway freight at Front Royal. Mills, it seems, attempted to cross the bumper, when the train gave a sudden lurch and caught his foot. Dr. Kipps was immediately upon the scene to render medical assistance. Amputa tion may be necessary. The cutting of the channel of the Ap pomattox River from Petersburg to James River, at City Point, to a depth of 12 feet and width of 40 feet, was completed Friday. The work was done by the United States Government, at a cost of  10 , 000 . The government will begin work immediately on the diversion of the Appomattox River, the cost of which will be  150 , 000 , to be paid for by the government. One man was killed and five others hurt by the bursting of a 28 -foot fly wheel in the bar mill of the Tredegar Iron Works, Richmond. The shed in which it was situated was wrecked, and the wheel, broken into several large pieces, flew in every direction, parts of it landing over on Gambles Hill Park, across the canal. The Old Virginia Copper Company, owned by Pittsburg and Indiana capi talists, has just been organized in Lu- ray. The company is to develop the mineral lands near Stony Man Camp, seven miles east of Luray. The home office is to be in Fort Wayne, Ind. The copper deposits at this place are said to be among the richest in the State. The police of Winchester are scouring the city and surrounding country for a young white man, supposed to be J. C. Rainey, of Jefferson county, West Vir ginia, who went by the name of M. C. Morgan, who is wanted for passing al leged worthless checks on Winchester merchants. The Henrico County Jail, built a few years ago, is about to collapse. Big cracks have occurred in the walls on account of the ground sinking. No pris oners are being kept in that part of the building because of the danger. A big sewer running under the jail is the probable cause of the trouble. In Lynchburg owners of all places of public resort, factories and boarding houses three stories or more in height have been notified that they must com ply with a new city ordinance which re quires the erection of iron fire-escapes. Mr. Gus Rock, a prominent farmer and citizen of Farnaham, was run over by a two-horse wagon loaded with to matoes. The wheel passed over his body, inflicting injuries from which he died. Thomas Parsons, colored, shot and killed Thomas Banks, another negro, at Rideway Church, in Buckingham, during a protracted meeting. Parsons claims self-defense, saying Banks hit him with his fist. Banks .is a bad name among the negroes of Buckingham, two of the name having committed atrocious mur ders recently. The annual convention of the Womans Christian Temperance Union of Win chester and Frederick county was held at Winchester in the Market Street Methodist Episcopal Church. Mrs. Amy Weech, State superintendent of evan gelistic work, responded to the address of welcome of Mrs. Arthur Leaf. Miss Lona A. Kerns, of Winchester, was elected president Miss Lizzie Arnold, of Stephen City, corresponding secretary Mrs. C. H. Buchanan, of Brucetown, re cording secretary, and Mrs. John Locke, of Stephen City, treasurer. Miss Lucy Anderton, of Tappahan- nock, on the Rappahannock River, and her guests had a narrow escape from drowning while sailing. In the boat were Miss Dorothy Hope and Mr. May, of Baltimore, and Mr. Henry Temple. The boat capsized in the channel and the occupants clung to it until rescued after a terrible experience by two negroes. Genevie Scott, the little son of Robert Scott, of Pocahontas, a suburb of Peters burg, attempted to jump on a freight train on the Norfolk and Western Rail road while passing through Blandford. He fell and had his right leg and arm so badly crushed that he died at the Home for the Sick. H. J. Fraley, a well-known citizen of Rappahannock county, is dead at his home near Sperryville, 14 miles east of Luray. His death was due to typhoid fever. Several other members of his family have the fever. Gideon Hoake, one of the oldest citi zens of Page county, died at his home near Ida, eight miles south of Luray. He was about 85 years of age and is survived by seven children. Mr. John H. Harrison, of Petersburg, and Mrs. Sallie Cordle, of Brunswick county, his sister, met in Petersburg for the first time in 20 years. Mrs. Cordle has been the mother of 10 children and the grandmother of 64 grandchildren. Nine of the former and 40 of the latter are now living, and she has three great grandchildren alive. Judge John D. Horsley fell down the steps at the Academy of Music, Lynch burg, in trying to save an old gentleman who had fallen. The Judge fractured his cheekbone. The incident probably will cause him to postpone a trip to Europe, which he was about to begin. I Magistrate Angle, of Henrico county, passed the death sentence on a dog train ed by three negro boys to steal .chickens and bring them to his masters. Many depredations have occurred by the use of this dog. The three negroesPercy Bundy, Charles Woodson and Benja min Joneswere sentenced for chicken I stealing. There was a head-on collision on the Norfolk and Western railroad at Suth erlands Station, Dinwiddle county, be tween a loaded easibound coal train and I an empty train going west. Both loco motives were badly damaged and five I cars wrecked."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["County", "Jail"], "snippet": "Winchester merchants.

It will be necessary, ac cording to Weinstock, that a county committee be named to prepare an overall economic development plan.
