No case of attack on the persons of American residents in Mexico has been reported, although there have been one or two attacks on vacant consulates and other American prop erty. Distributed By Raids. Part of the increasing apprehension here is due to the renewed raids in the Laredo region. Several reports dealing with the situation there have been received. Officials declined to re- val details, but they gave the impres sion of having reason to believe a seri ous purpose waR behind the bandit raid on the Coleman ranch. Three raiders were killed and three captured, one re port said, adding that they attempted to burn a railroad bridge near Laredo, but failed. The new force sent to join General Funptons border patrol, Secretary Baker said, was to fill in gaps in the guard, such as that near Laredo. It will be composed of 10 companies of coast artillery and a battalion of engi neers. The artillerymen will be with drawn from fortifications between Portland, Maine, and Sandy Hook, and the engineers go from barracks in this city.1 The Secretary said there was no present intention of calling out addi tional National Guard regiments for border duty. Cavalrymen Fired On. General Mann, commanding at La redo, reported that a patrol of three cavalrymen was fired on during the night of June 10 near the town of Hachita and Private W. L. Saunders, of Troop K, Twelfth Cavalry, slightly wounded. Two mounted Mexicans, who did the firing, escaped. A message from Captain Burrage, commanding the battleship Nebraska at Vera Cruz, said there was consider able unrest in that region, due ap parently, to the currency situation.

There probably will be some amended regulations based on actual experience with the first increment, and some amendments in the law may be thought desirable by Congress. It is possible that some provision will be made whereby all the sons of one family will not be taken. A new definition of the status of married men may be one of the things acted upon. President Wilsons recent letter to Senator Weeks is taken by many to indicate a feeling that a more liberal policy may be found desirable.

The incorporators are John Hay, Secretory of State, Edward D. White, Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Daniel Coit Gilman, late President of the Johns Hopkins University. Charles D. Walcott, superintendent of the Geological Survey. John S. Billings, ex-Surgeon-General of the Navy. Carroll D. Wright, Commissioner of Labor. The articles fix the name and title of the institution as the Carnegie Institu tion and show that it is organized  for a perpetual term. Its objects are the promotion of study and research, the power to acquire, hold and convey real estate and other property, and to estab lish general and special funds to as sist investigations in science, literature or art to co-operate with governments, universities, colleges, technical schools, learned societies and individuals to ap point committees of experts to direct special lines of research, publish and distribute documents, conduct lectures and hold meetings, acquire and maintain a library, and in general to do and per form all things necessary to promote the objects of said institution. The affairs, funds and property of the corporation will be in general charge of a board of trustees, to consist during the first year of 27, and thereafter not to exceed 30 members, except by a three- quarter vote of the board. . The filing of the papers followed a meeting in the offee of Secretary Hay, which was attended by all of the incor porators and Mr. Baker.

It was said that such securities in the posses sion of the United States, the income of which was used for the- promotion of education, might seriously embarrass the Department of Justice in the event of legal action being taken against combi nations or trusts. So Mr. Carnegie was informed their acceptance was impossi ble.  A few days later, Mr. Carnegie ap peared at the White House and dined with the President, after which it was announced Mr. Carnegie had decided to remove all grounds for objection.

The Liberty Motor, the airplane engine upon which the United States is relying to establish definite air supremacy over the Ger mans over the battlefields of France, has passed its final test and is a com plete and gratifying success, Secretary Baker announced.

Secretary Baker says the motor is I now the main reliance of the United States in the rapid production in large numbers of high-power battle planes for service in the war. In power, speed and serviceability and minimum weight, he continues, the new engine invites comparison with the best that the European war has produced. The engine was brought about through the co-operation of more than a score of engineers, who pooled their skill and trade secrets in the war emergency. For obvious reasons specifications of the motor, details of its perform ance under test and arrangements made for its production in quantity are I withheld. In conclusion, however, Mr. Baker says Progress has already been made toward organizing the industry for the manufacture of the new machines and deliveries will begin in a com paratively short time. Back of that announcement stands the fact that American aviators in high-powered American-built machines will begin to appear in large numbers on the fighting lines early next year.

In a battle following an unsuccessful attempt to rob the First National Bank, of this place, one man was killed and another seriously Wounded. The dead man was one of the burglars, smd he has not yet been identified. The wounded man was Henry Willoughby, a baker, who surprised the burglars while at work. His injuries are serious, hut not fatal. Willoughby was passing the bank at an early hour on his way to work, when he was suddenly confronted by a man, who, at the point of a revolver, ordered him to throw up his hands and keep quiet. He did so, but in his right hand was a revolver, and a moment later both men fired at each other. At the report of the revolvers two other men rushed from the bank and took a hand in the shooting. The three-cornered revolver fight aroused some of the people in the vicin ity of the bank, and they were soon at the scene of the battle, but before thei  arrival the burglars fled. While the mer had broken into the banking rooms they had not completed the drilling of the safe, and their attempt at robbery was unsuccessful. The body of one of the burglars was discovered on a vacant lofin the upper end of town. As the bullet wound was near the heart, it is presumed that his compan ions had to drag or drive their dying companion from the bank to where he was found. While he was dressed in only an ordinary suit of clothes, he was not shabbily dressed, and on his body was found a gold watch and. 44 in cash. Willoughby was shot in both legs, and it is supposed he fired the shot that killed the burglar."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["baker"], "snippet": "was Henry Willoughby, a <mark>baker</mark>, who surprised the burglars"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["baker"], "snippet": "was Henry Willoughby, a <mark>baker</mark>, who surprised the burglars"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
