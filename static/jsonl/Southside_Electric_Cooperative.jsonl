The Southside Electric Coop erative has invested less than 200,088 in this development and study project. Already one Munidpality, Blackstone, has invested 2,500 in the project and other dties and towns, where electridty is purchased wholesale and then distributed retail, are eyeing the project as an investment for a source of wholesale electric energy in the future. The Board of Directors of the Southside Electric Cooperative is furnishing the present leadership for this electric generating complex, and, some time in the future, will work out a separate corporate structure to construct and continue developing the complex. Other rural electric sys tems, munidpalities like Black- stone, and even commercial power companies may become involved in the financing of this electrical generating complex, in this count down to electric independence.
