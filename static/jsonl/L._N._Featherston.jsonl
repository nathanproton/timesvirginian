Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

No history of a rural school system of by-gone days is com plete that does not mention the place of the school as a com munity center and the teacher as the leader in the community. Appomattox is no exception. Be cause the school was usually near the center of the communi ty  therefore, in walking dis tance or later driving distance it was used for religious meet ings, especially for Sunday School for those too far to go to churoh, the Grange and other farm organizations. How many people have enjoyed the fellow ship of each other while plann ing and executing box parties, pie suppers, sings, oyster supp ers and bazaars to make money for the school, but at the same time have a little fun along with it. The teachers visit in the home was once a great occasion to teacher, pupil and! parents. Her visit warded off trouble with Johnny as he great to know her as an individual. She could know Johnny better as she saw him in his natural surroundings. After she had spent the night in ihis home she was usually his friend. The teacher was able to introduce new ideas into the home since she usually was one of the most respected individuals of the com munity. She taught Sunday School, played the organ, may be .got up a play or Christmas program at church or school. Unconsciously she was molding opinions. Sometimes she capti vated the heart of a young swain who saw to it that she remained in the community where she reared a family and in turn be came .a patron yes, a better patron than some she had had. As schools grew and roads im proved the whole faculty was invited to supper in a number of the homes. There good food and good fellowship were in such abundance that each person pre sent felt inspired to return to his job and do a better piece of work. To the unknown teacher be longs much of the credit for the progress of the system."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["N", "Featherston"], "snippet": "before becoming superintendent Mi <mark>N</mark>.

The deceased was a descend-1 ant of prominent pioneer families   of Campbell and Appomattox Counties and inherited their sterling qualities, gentleness of spirit and disposition, and talents of a home-maker. Being a child of the Reconstruction period, and the eldest daughter of a widowed mother, she learned economic independence early in life that gave her a broad under-  standing, general sympathy, and a prophetic vision of changing conditions. She joined New Hope Baptist Church in early girlhood and after her marriage to Mr. Burke, May 27, 1874, she became a con sistent member of Liberty Bap tist Church. Her love and  . thoughtful care were the inspir ation of her husband, her relig ious ideas and progressive ideas sent into the world eight leaders in church and secular activities, and her lavish hospitality en deared her and her family to a host of friends. Her influence for good was recognized through out the county, and having been next one to the longest residents of Appomattox she was beloved by distinguished and humble, rich and poor, young and old, white and colored. She knew i the joys and trials of youth, and all who had temporary homes with her spoke of her as their ! second mother, who exercised unselfishness, patience, and abil ity to draw out the best in those who came in touch with her. No word of adverse criticism passed her lips. She lived on a lofty, intellectual plane that ele vated those under her watch- care.  Truly a mother in Israel has , gone to her reward. Hers was no bland piety, but her life was ! a living epistle of her Saviors j teachings, and her children rise up and call her blessed. She embodied the finer traditions of  the past, and was conversant I with all developments of the present, and her full mind was I a beacon unto loved ones and I acquaintances. Hundreds of callers, numerous I telegrams from different states, many floral tributes attested for her wide popularity and general esteem. She is survived by the follow- j ing children Mrs. Walter C.

We have gathered here today to honor our boys and girls who have gone out to fight for us, for their country and, we believe, for their God. These boys and girls should have, and I feel sure they have, the prayers of the folks back home. But you mu. t remember we do not have to wai for the assem bling at c.iureh to offer our pray ers. The Lord will hear the pray ers of his pqople at any moment, day or night, they are offered. 1 firmly believe that if every person in America who professes to be a follower oi the Lord and Savior would live up to.the standards of Christianity, all the mighty hosts of the enemy, with their immense war machinery would crumble before that body of Christians. It is our prayer that as our soldiers will march successfully, following the Star Spangled Banner of our coun try, they may not forget that sin gle star that guided the wise men to Bethlehem, and in winning this war they may win a lasting peace for this world, and we should strive to reach their goal, and in present ing to this church this plaque with the following names Jerry A Burke, Jr., Jennings W. Conner, Carl E. Evans, Harry B. Giles, Robert Pol lard Kinney, C. William Redding, Richard Floyd Burke, TH, Sidnor A. Conner, William L. Evans, Charles F. James, Jr., Douglas S.
