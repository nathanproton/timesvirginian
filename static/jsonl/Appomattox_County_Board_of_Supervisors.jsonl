And, from a terrorist attack in Beirut, Lebanon to a youth wool contest in Blacksburg, Va., stories involving Appomattox Countys people were chronicled for the 92nd year in the pages of the Times-Virginian news paper. Following are some glimpses of the year about to end, as gleaned from the front pages of the Times-Virginian The year began with stories detailing a state study to locate possible sites for a low-level nuclear dump in the Old Dominion. Appomat tox Countians learned in the Jan. 6 issue of the times-virginian that their county was one of 18 being considered for location of the dump site. The nuke-dump issue came up again in the Jan. 20 Times-VIrginian, when the Appomattox County Board of Supervisors stated publically that they were opposed to a dump site in the county. The Jan. 20 issue also carried a story on the opening of Brandy Ann Manufacturing company in the old Pamplin School building, which provided jobs for many Pamplin residents who were left jobless when the towns Amelia Garment factory burned in 1982. The Feb. 3 Times-Virginum noted that the local cable television system was being expanded, with 60,000 feet of able on hand and in the process of being installed. The following week readers learned that Neighborhood Watch programs were being started around tlie county in response to s rise in local burglaries. The Feb. 24 paper carried a story on Linda Ruhfs second-grade class at Appomattox Primary School, which sent messages of cheer to U.S. servicemen stationed aboard the U.S.S.Shreveport, off the coast ol Lebanon. The March 3 edition of the paper noted with sadness the death of Andy Scruggs, a beloved member of the community noted for his volunteer work with the local rescue squad and fire department. The first glimmerings of political activity in the county were apparent in the March 10 issue of the paper, when Commonwealths Attor ney W. Sam Kerr announced that he would not seek re-election in the November election, and incumbent County Supervisor Horace Coleman announced that he would seek re-election ,to the Clover Hill District seat. More hats were thrown into the local political ring the following week, when David Nash announced that he would oppose Coleman for the Clover Hill supervisors seat, Franklin Vaughan announced that he would seek re-election to the Stonewall Supervi sors seat, and local attorney Thomas W.

The House Bill, which is co-sponsored by Congressmen Caldwell Butler and Robert Daniel would define navigable waters as contained in Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. That definition terma navigable waters aa those which are presently used, or are suscepti ble to use in their natural condition or by reasonable improvement aa a means to transport interstate com merce. Controversy began several months ago when the Corps of Engineers made public its intention to expand its jurisdic tion over every lake, stream, stock pond and irrigation ditch in the nation - - this being its definition of navigable wat ers. The Board of Supervisors of Appomattox County and the Appomattox Town Council in June at 1975 went on record as opposing the attempt to extend federal control over all waters within the town and county. Letters stating their opposition were written from the Town of Appomattox to U.8. Senators Harry F. Byrd and William Scott aad Congressman W. C. Dan Daniel 5th District.  Representative Dan Daniel hai warned that regulations proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expanding its authority over all water ways I the country would constitute land use planning by another name. According to the 5th District representative, under the poli cy any landowner wishing to build a structure that comes in contact with the water is required to get a permit from the Corps. Unless legislation now pending in Congress to alleviate the problem is passed, the Corps will soon need a bureocracy double its present size to fulfill the functions which it projects for itself. The Bedford County, Camp bell County, Amherst County, and Appomattox County Board of Supervisors, in addition to Appomattox Town Council and the Bedford City Council have all passed resolutions opposing the Corps expanded authority. The CVPDC also passed a similar resolution in May. At the Recommendation of the Smith Mountain-LeeaviUe Reservoirs Committee the Commission adopted the reso lution supporting the House Bill which would provide an acceptable definition of naviga ble waters to localities. In other action the Commis sion also passed a resolution opposing the changing of the effective date of the scheduled annual increase for General Registrars proposed by the State Board of Elections. According to Roy C. Mayo, HI, Amherst County Adminis trator and Chairman of the Commissions Governmental Administrators Technical Com mittee, the State Board of Elections wants to change the date of annual increases for General Registrars from July 1 to March 1. This change would create a great deal of confusion for localities since we use July 1 aa the standard date for salary increases for county and municipal employees. Budget ary complications will result if we have to work with both the July 1 and the March 1 dates, said Mayo. The resolution opposing the date change was passed unanimously by the Commis sion.

Tbe board wpuld, under this plan, authorize tlje Department of Welfare to administer a Housing and Urban Development HUD Section-Eight plan, whereby the county would receive funds to upgrade existing housing for use by low-income families.

The proposed apartment complex would, according to federal guidelines, be available for elderly and handicapp- edpersons.  Watkins Abbitt, -appointed by the Board of Supervisors to head the county housing committee, noted that the preliminary plans as presented would not, in his opinion, be suitable for elderly or handicapped persons. Abbitt said the preliminary plans call for steps eight feet high leading to the apiartments.

Some Virginia counties use ratios much lower than 40 per cent of the true value. Such counties would lose heavily in tax income were the changed procedure adopted.

Much of the session was de voted to matters concerning public schools. A delegation appeared in behalf of the dental clinic now in progress at the Appomattox High School. An appropriation was sought to enable dental work to be done for pupils whose parents were not able to pay the clinic charges. The board appro priated 400 for this purpose. J. A. Burke, division school su perintendent, appeared to present school financial problems. The su pervisors agreed to transfer a total of 30,412.34 from the county gen eral fund to the school general fund. This is in line with policy in recent years to transfer available general funds to the schools. Mr. Burke brought before the board long-range plans for construc tion at Appomattox High School. These plans call for the addition of a gymnasium and four more class rooms. He asked the board to put in application for a loan of 100,000 from the state literary fund for thia purpose. It was held that this sum, plus possible state grants, would finance the construction. - The supervisors took no action on this matter. It was decided that such a loan would cause an increase in tax rates and that building costs were uncertain at this time, all this being tied into the fact that the county already has a sizeable debt for school construction.  A resolution was adopted asking the General Assembly to prohibit the use of high-powered rifles in Appomattox County. Another resolution would favor the State Corporation Cbffimission to make corporation assessments on a county-wide, rather than a magis terial districts.
