There was au unusually large at tendance of the sovereigns from every part of the county on last Thursday, the regular term of the County Court. Mauy of them were doubtless attracted by the wide spread interest in the trial of the negroes George Flowers aud Charles Robertson who had been indicted aud imprisoned for the murder of Bob Boler near Spout Spring, on the uight of the 4th of January last. The parties indicted and the import ant witnesses had all made fiatly contradictory statements and an im penetrable mystery seemed to overhang the tragedy. There bad been a negro frolic and dance, the parliciputs, male and female,- be coming uproarious from whiskey. On the way home Bob Boler, Letitia Carson, George Flowers aud Charles Robertson were walking together apart from the othei s. A scuffle en sued between George Flowers and Bob Boler they were separated aud the puny walked on a few paces when pistol shots were heard and Bob Boler fell to the ground mort ally wounded, ana his dead body was left in the middle of the road. These were all of the facts about which there was direct, uncontra- dicted testimony. A jury was empannelled in the case of George Flowers, without de lay or difficulty,consisting of the fol io wiug persons F. G. Thorpe, C. M. Diiukard, Seaborn Gilbert, Fielding Rogers, Ro. W. Morris, Jas. W. Paris, Samuel J. Lee, Samuel Rauson, P. H. Wooldridge, T. L. Cralie, W. T. Marshall, and Alouzu Hamilton. Mr. S. L.

Mr. Fergusou managed the case with ability and gave abundant evi dence that he will make an efficient States Attorney. Col. Poore and Mr. Flood threw their utmost ener gies iuto the case, aud it is unneces sary to add that their efforts were vigorous and brilliant. The case occupied two days, and on Friday alternoou the jury brought in a ver dict of guilty and awarded the ac cused tea years in the peuitentiary. The counsel for the Commonwealth demanded only a verdict for murder iu the second decree, for which the punishment is confinement in the penitentiary admitting to the jury that they were unable to establish the ingredient of premeditation necessary - to elevate the homicide to murder iu the first degree. Col. Poore moved the Court to set aside the verdict and award the prisoner a new trial, upon the following grounds First That the verdict was con trary to the law and the evidence.

It was a case of rain outside and Flood inside yesterday, and a gen eral all-round April-fool for those who attended the Police Court in expectation that a result would be reached in the cause of Senator H. D. Flood, who is charged with an assault upon Senator W. M. Flana gan, of Powhatan. The difficulty between the sena tors occurred during the closing days of the legislative session, and the trial was set for to-day from an examination held early m the past month. At an early hour yesterday morn ing, men began to arrive, and at 10 oclock the court-room was crowded to its utmost capacity, for all thought that the much-discussed case would be finally determined. It was a little after 10 oclock when Justice Crutchfield called the case of H. D. Flood,and immediately the hum and buzz of the expectant throng caused Sergeant Thomas to rap vigorously for order. In the row of seats reserved for the attorneys sat Commonwealths- Attorney Harry Smith, and neur him sat Senator Flanagan, who was not represented by any assistant in the prosecution. General Edgar Allan, who was in the court in the former hearing was not present, and Judge Waddill, another friend of Mr. Flanagan was also absent. Senator Flood occupied a chair between Senator Conway R. Sands and Mr. Charles V. Meredith his counsel. Justice Crutchfield called the following witnesses Malcolm A. Coles, H. L. Maynard, 6. T. Snead, F. B. Watkins, Dr. Pierce, Dr. Jeffries, Dr. Michaux, O. T. Crump, James R. Werth, Morris Parr, Mor ris Evws, Major Robert Stiles, Frank Perkins, and Norman Ran dolph. He then announced that a number of the witnesses had not responded to their names, and the list was recalled. MR. EVANS ABSENT. Mr. Flanagan had then come in side the rail just before the Justice. He stated that Mr. Morris Evans, was not present. Mr. Smith asked Mr. Flanagan if he thought they could get along without Mr. Evans, and Mr. Flana gan replied that he considered Mr. Evans one of the most important of all the witnesses. It then became apparent that the case would have again to be post poned. Mr. Evans lives in Powha tan and was expected on the Alle ghany road from Columbia this morning. Justice Crutchfield had the railroad office telephoned to and found that the train had ar rive on time. It was then suggested that possibly Mr. Evans had been unable to reach the railroad on ac count of the high water in the river near Columbia. Justice Crutchfield announced that he was very sorry to be com pelled to again continue the case, as the witnesses were many of them, brought from some distance, and that the expense to the state was large. Mr. Smith here jocularly remarked that as many of the witnesses were members of the Legislature, they were also of course opposed to in creasing the criminal expenses of the State."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Commonwealths", "Attorney"], "snippet": "for the attorneys sat <mark>Commonwealths</mark>- <mark>Attorney</mark> Harry Smith, and neur"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Commonwealths", "Attorney"], "snippet": "for the attorneys sat <mark>Commonwealths</mark>- <mark>Attorney</mark> Harry Smith, and neur"}], "text_match": 2310390568233992313, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2220487802880", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 1, "score": "2310390568233992313", "tokens_matched": 4, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Newport News.That the city of Newport News saved itself six or eight thousand dollars a year when it em  ployed a police justice at a salary of  4,000 a year In lieu of hail fees, is I shown by the statement of the police clerk for the first week In the new I year. Bail fees collected during that j week totaled more than 200, and the number of arrests made and persons bailed was comparatively small. Ar-  rests. a year ago were two or three I times, as numerous as at present which leads to the belief that the re cent police justice, who kept all fees in addition to his salary, made some thing like 12,000 or more annually.

Have you heard the whistles ! the engines as they come puffing in on our new roads?  a common salutation on our Streets now- a days, but as yet we have to be satisfied with the N.  W. and Tide wh ter  Western. Still we an hoping and what would life be with out it? The engineers tell us that Farmville is difficult of approach, and hence the ned ssity of the high bridge that the old Southside might enter our gates, and the Tidewatc t has to  Y in. I dont know just what the others will do in order t. come in and secure footing, but out gates stand wide open to receive them night and day. To give them proper welcome, however, we need to start the sounding of some nev whistles ourselves. The town must wake up or the trains will come and go unnoticed. Mr. W. T. Clark and his children have taken rooms at H, C. Pauletts and his new beautiful home on High Street rent. Mr. and Mrs. Lucken Bugg are snugly fixed in the Baldwin house on West High Street. Mr. Richard Cunningham, of Richmond, was a recent visitor in town. His mother and sisters, who are now living in Washington, D. C., will move to Richmond in the early Fall. Mrs. Joyner and child, of Suffolk, are guests in the home of Mr. Geo. Richardson. Mrs. Ellen C. Jones, who has an attractive home at Hampden-Sid- ney, has rented it to the Sigma Society and it will make a most de lightful club home. She will still have the use of the property during the vacation and there she and her daughters will continue to spend their summers. Miss Franke Jones, her eldest daughter and a recent graduate of the Normal has been offered posi tions in the High School at Char lottesville and also in that of Pearis- burg, Giles County, and all of our graduates, I am told sftre being well provided for. Virginia made nc mistake in establishing the Farm ville Female Normal nor in provid ing for it so liberally. The returns being made by her daughters is more than a hundred fold. Some new wheat is coming in a nd our faithful mill is busy night and day. Our farm horses begin to show the results of hard work on the farms, though as a general thing our farmers are taking better care of their stock than in years gone by Judge Mann, who is asking to be returned to the Senate from this district iB being opposed by Mr. Wallace, of Lunenburg. No joint discussions have been announced and I do not see where the fun of the present canvas is to come in at. No speaking, no treatin, no barbe cues, but just a dead, quiet and easy old campaign. No not an old- time campaign, but a modern day under the directions of the Barks dale Pure ? Election Law, The Citizens Bank in its bow to the public says that  the increas ing wealth and business of this community call for additional bank ing facilities to meet this growing need. Thats optimistic, the hope ful, cheerful salutation of young men. Of course they will succeed for in the lexicon of youth there is no such word as fail. Judge WatkinBhas no opposition for the position of Commonwealths Attorney, nor has Mr. Dickerson for the Sheriffalty, nor Mr. Owen for the House of Delegates. And in two districts aspirants for the Board of Supervisors will have walk overs Mr. Haskins in Leigh, and Dr. Holladay in Hampden.

He was colonel ot the Ninth Virginia Infantry during the civil war and served till the close of hostilities with distinction and gallantry. He was severely wounded at the battle ot Alleghany mountain. At the restoration of peace he removed to his farm, near Salem, resumed tbe practice of law and soon en joyed a Urge and luoratlve practice.

The shooting was done by a white man named Wood, who olalms that the man wot l.i his watermelon patch. M B Noel, for many years In the stone business in Lynchburg, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors The assets are estimated at 2,500 liabilities not stated. Considerable excitement was caused In Boanoke by the attempt of a colored girl named Lulu Corellas to kill Capt. M. M. Rogers, a prominent citizen of Roanoke county, residing a short distance from tbe southern limits of this city. The girl had been employed as a domestic in Captain Rog ers family, but owing to her independence and Insolence was discharged a few days ago, after a very stormy scene In wblvh she declared she would kill Captain Rogers.

The pistol was taken from her and found to be a 32-calibre of six chambers, two of which wero loaded. The first payment has been made by the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad Company on the property just purchased at Pinners Point from tho Portsmouth Water Front Company, nnd plans - have been pre pared for extensive improvements in that locality. The Bouthorn Railway Company owners of tbe adjoining docks an l ware houses, has asked for an estimate from the New York Dredging Company for a founda tion for the largo colton compress which tho Southern purposes removing from City Point to Pinners Point by the time the fall business sets in. These operations are likely to give employment to a large building force for several montbe.
