The program was observed outside except the literary exercises, which had to be held in the Courthouse, and not in the park surrounding the monument. Fully 5,000 people from all parts of the Virginia Peninsula and many from afar were gathered to join in the cele bration. The houses and stores of the old town were appropriately decorated, the French flag being frequently noted At 1 oclock a military parade started, made up by the coast artillery camps, a band from Fort Monroe, a battalion of sailors and a band from Norfolk Navy Yard, a battalion of sailors from the United States scout cruiser Bir mingharti and a company from the revenue cutters Onandaga and Apache The civic division consisted of 250 men and women on horseback, which cav alcade included 40 members of the or der of Red Men of York county. Aboul 200 students of William and Mary Col lege, at Williamsburg, also formed s part of the civic division. Roanoke.M. M. Spence, yard con ductor for the Virginia Railway in this city, was murdered by an unidentified man in the western edge of town, and, although bloodhounds were on the scene two hours after the killing, they failed to take the scent, and, so far. there Is no clue to the Identity of the conductors slayer. Spence was seen by fellow workmen 15 minutes before his dead body was discovered in a poo of blood with the juglar vein severed and the face and hAnds cut into rib bons. One man says he saw Spence and another man, whom he did not know, walking together on the rail road yard earlier in the day, and that they were quarreling. There was evi dence of a terrible struggle. Spence was married two months ago to Miss Alice Himes, who was stenographer to the city engineer. He was 25 years old and popular. Harrisonburg.Fire resulting from an exploding lamp destroyed the six- room dwelling of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Wood, near Spring Creek, Rockingham county, and now parents and seven children, the eldest 14, are left home less and penniless. Mrs. Wood went to bed upstairs, leaving five of the children studying their lessons in the kitchen, where the explosion occurred. Mr. Wood, who was visiting a neigh bor, rushed home with 75 people of the community, who formed a bucket brig ade, but in 30 minutes the residence was In ashes. By the hardest sort of work the fire fighters managed to save the henhouse and washhouse near the dwelling. Mr. Wood is a workingman and had no insurance on the place. Suffolk.  Accused of sending his brother, Elmer Daniel, who is in jail here, a bottle of poison with which to commit suicide, Oscar Daniel was sent to the Nansemond County Jail The jail officials say they intercepted a letter from Oscar to Elmer, which indicated that a suicide pact bad been formed between the two. Elmer Dan iel was arrested a few days ago on tht charge of holding up A. V. Sturgeon with a shotgun. After being locked up Daniel drank of a bottle ol laudanum which he had concealed in his stocking at that time to carry out his plan of self-destruction at the next favorable opportunity. Harrisonburg.A. G. Waterman, ol New York city, has presented the town with a school site, valued at 5,000, on the well-known Waterman property, in the western suburbs of Harrisonburg, and a new 15,000 structure will be ready for occupancy by September, 1911. The crowded condition forced the school board to hunt for a site to build a new school. In response to a letter asking for a price of the Wat erman site, the owner generously pre sented the land to the town, with the proviso that it should always be used for public purposes. Lynchburg.It has been ascertained that Leonard Campbell, the 4-year-old boy who died in a hospital here, was a victim of anthrax, a cattle disease which seldom attacks a human being. This was discovered by a microscop ical examination of the blood after death. Dr. Lile, the physician in charge of the case, will make a com plete report of it to a leading medical journal. Anthrax was prevalent among cattle near the home of the boy. Winchester.While climbing a 10- foot pole to reach for a chain attached to an electric street lamp, Thomas Clem, the 15-year-old son of Jerry Clem, was electrocuted. The moment he touched the wire chain several women in the neighborhood warned the boy to stay down, but he did not heed their advice. It is supposed that the chain was charged by the hanging wire."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["school", "board"], "snippet": "crowded condition forced the <mark>school</mark> <mark>board</mark> to hunt for a"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["school", "board"], "snippet": "crowded condition forced the <mark>school</mark> <mark>board</mark> to hunt for a"}], "text_match": 1157451471441100921, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2211897868288", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1157451471441100921", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

A settle ment of the controversy in the Paci fic Coast States arising over the ex clusion of Japanese pupils from pub lic schools has been reached. Mayor Schmitz and the members of the San Francisco school board gave assurance to the President that if the amended bill becomes a law they will abolish the oriental schools in San Francisco and will admit Ja panese pupils to the white schools. These agreements were arrived at after conferences between the Presi dent and his friends in the Senate regarding the Immigration Bill, and after two conferences between Presi dent Roosevelt and Secretary Root on one side and Mayor Schmitz and other visitors from San Francisco on the other. After a conference with the President Mayor Schmitz gave out this statement We have come to a satisfactory understanding upon the assumption that Congress will pass the amend ment to the Immigration Bill intro duced February 13. The filibustering tactics on the Im migration Bill in the Senate were brought to a close by assurances from the White House that there would be no ruling on the practice, inauguarated by South Carolina, of states importing foreign labor. Sev eral Southern senators believed that the new bill would prohibit further importations of foreign labor by states. Both Messrs. Bacon and Till man disclaimed any intention to con duct a filibuster, and many other Democratic senators stated that even if the Georgia Senator and the South Caolina Senator did entertain such a purpose theywould not follow them. During the debate on the Immigra tion Bill in the Senate a member of the Cabinet, Who was on the floor, told senators that tbe subject of state immigration had received the atten tion of the Cabinet at its meeting and that there had been a general conclusion that the terms of the bill would not require a new ruling in the South Carolina case. Instead of the Senate discussing that clause of the bill which relates to the Japanese situation, and which is really the only reason why the Im migration Bill has been resurrected, the entire day was devoted to a clause in the bill which some of the Southern senators believed will make it impossible for a state to bring im migrants from Europe. The debase degenerated simply into a wrangle between Senator Lodge, representing the cotton-mill owners of Massachu setts, and Senator Tillman, represent ing the cotton-mill owners of South Carolina."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["school", "board"], "snippet": "of the San Francisco <mark>school</mark> <mark>board</mark> gave assurance to the"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["school", "board"], "snippet": "of the San Francisco <mark>school</mark> <mark>board</mark> gave assurance to the"}], "text_match": 1157451471441100921, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2211897868288", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1157451471441100921", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Pending the arrival of Mayor Bohmitz, of San Francisco, and the aembers of the local school board, U of whom started for Washington Sunday night, the Japanese situation will rest unchanged. Were it to come to war with Japan, of which I see not the least danger, said Admiral George Dewey a short time ago, there would be no cause for alarm. We could get ur navy into Eastern waters in six weeks, and within two weeks after Its arrival there the Japanese navy could be swept from the face of the earth. If war should be declared, he said, the Philippines would doubt less be seized by the Japanese, and possibly Hawaii. This could be done before we could reach the scene of action, but no sooner would we ar rive there than we could retake them. Our present navy is amply able to deal with that of the Japan ese and to insure no doubt of the immediate issue in case of a conflict. By this I do not mean that the aavy should not be increased con stantly, for money so spent is the strongest possible insurance of peace sad, as an insurance, well spent. But there is no immediate danger. There is no denying the fact that Japan is entirely exhausted financial ly, and it is preposterous to suppose that she could finance an enterprise so monstrous as a war with a pow erful nation. There is another matter that is being much discussed, and that is  matter of great coast defenses and the possibility of a foreign nation Japan, for instancetaking one of our seaport cities. In the science of Warfare it is ridiculous to suppose that any nation would attempt to do so. Should Japan capture San Yrancisco it would require her entire aavy to hold the port and her forces would be cut off from all source of supply and surrounded on the land aide by the entire military force of this nation. Were such a thing pos sible it would never be practicable and will never be tempted by any nation. We are too powerful a na tion for any other nation to fancy that it could fasten its forces upon us and retain the hold. Coast de fense Is not a need of the nation. It is known by those close to the administration that when the war cloud first arose Admiral Dewey was summoned to the White House and was asked his opinion as to whether or not the present navy would be able to cope with the Japanese in case of a conflict. The Admiral is reported to have been very positive in his declarations aa to the various rumors that have been circulated of late relative to the possibilities of war and as to the manner in which they have been received in different circles. He is known to have expressed the opin ion that the attitude of some men in high authority over the Japanese is nothing less than damn cowardice. B e has denounced forcibly on all .occasions the show of dread of a Conflict with Japan, and holds that If trouble is to come it would be advisable to precipitate it now rather than wait until Japan had recuper ated from the Russian conflict."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["school", "board"], "snippet": "aembers of the local <mark>school</mark> <mark>board</mark>, U of whom started"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["school", "board"], "snippet": "aembers of the local <mark>school</mark> <mark>board</mark>, U of whom started"}], "text_match": 1157451471441100921, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2211897868288", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1157451471441100921", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The district School Board met last Saturday evening at Chestnut Grove church to confer as to the advisability of consolidating several schools in their, Francisco district We learn they decided to unite the Forbes and Chestnut Grove schools and to erect a new school building on the Stage road at the most ac cessible point to the children who attended each school. We believe the board acted wisely in uniting these schools for neither one made an average, and we are strongly of the opinion that one good school is better than two small schools. Non attendance does more to prevent our educational system from being a success in the rural districts than any other one cause. The State may erect the most modern and up- to-date school buildings, and fur nish the best teachers that the countiy can afford, and let the chil dren stay at home, as a majority of them do and education will not adyanc . very rapidly. We trust that the people will realize the ne cessity of regular attendance ami that this school will be one of the best in the county. The entertainment at ConcorJ Baptist church on July 4th was a grand success. About 55 was cleared for the church. All pres ent seemed to enjoy it and were especially delighted with the magic lantern show and lecture by Rev. T. H. Athey, of Lynchburg.
