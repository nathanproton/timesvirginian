All of this seemed but a prepara tion for the brilliant afgpir of tbe coming week for, many days before, tasteful cards of invitation had been issued by Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Atwood, announcing that on Monday, Jan.. 1st there Would be a reception at their lome, which is known by the pretty name qf Cherwood.

Each train, aa it pulled Into the station, left be hind its bevy of merry yonng people, and the village for a time assumed the airs and importance of a metrop olis. - Richmond, Lynchburg, Farm ville, Bhrkeville and Pamplin City, contributed to swell the crowd. By 9 oclock Cherwood was filled with the most beautiful and attract ive . gathering that has - ever a dis tinguished the social life of Appomat tox. The house was brilliantly illu minated and gracefully decorated, and it would require the pen and dis- criptive talent of a superhuman power to describe the exquisite toilets of jbe occasion. The yonng ladies in their beautiful -and varied oos tomes and the chivalry with their black evening suits and glossy white sfiift fronts made a pleasing and agreeable contrast as they sauntered in and out of the elegant apartments. Mrs. J. R. Atwood received in a cream brocade satin, point desprit lace and diamond ornaments. She was assisted by Mrs. Martin Harvey, Mrs. T. A. Woodson, Mrs. A. B. Da vis and Mrs. J. L. Chernault.

In the centre of the same was an immense pyramid, composed, of every frnit imaginable, and ar ranged so artistically that one might well have deemed it a picture. The feast included the fairest products of Summer and the daintiest morsels of Winter. Mr. E.

The joint convention of the Dem ocrats of Appomattox and Campbell counties, to nominate a candidate to the constitutional convention, met at West Appomattox on last Satur day the 20th instant. The original arrangement was for this cou veiltiou to be held at Kustburg, but inasmuch its the Campbell delegates had instructed  Judge Nelson to cast the vote of Campbell for such person as Appo mattox might present as her choice, Judge Nelson kindly accepted the invitation of the Democratic chair man of Appomattox to meet the delegates of the latter county at this place. Judge Frank Nelson was called upon to preside over the joint con vention, and Mr. T. A. Smith was chosen secretary. Col. R b. Poore in a few graceful remarks placed in nomination the Hon. H. D. Flood. Judge Nelson tempoiarily vacated the chair in or der to second the nomination. Iu the course of his earnest and cordi al remarks the Judge took occasion to disavow in the mos. emphatic manner the rumors which he learn ed had reached Appomattox of a purpose on the part of the Demo crats of Campbell, or of some mem bers of he party, to contest with Appomattox the choice of the nomi nee for the constitutional conven tion. He said that it was thorough ly understood, always had beeu, and always would be, that Appomattox was entitled to choose ihe nominee for the floater of the House of Del egates, and tUat the same principle was recognized uow iu the choice of a nominee for the constitutional convention. In a very haudsome and eiequent manner Judge Nelson affirmed that Campbell couuty had reasi to be proud of the two distinguished gen- tlemeu in whose nomination to the constitutional convention she had participated aud he declared that the names of John W. Daniel and H. JJ. Flood were associated togeth er iu the minds aud admiration of the people of Virgiuia as two of the noblest aud most gifted sons whom the fertile womb of the mother of s ates and statesmen had ever pro duced. The nomination of Mr. Flood was thereupon carried by acclamation. Messrs. IS. P. Colemau, C. H. Fur- bush and A. H. Clement were appointed a committee to wait upon Mr. Flood aud bring him before the convention. The appearance of the committee iu charge of the nominee, with his blushing honors thick upon him, was the signal for enthusiastic ap plause. Mr. Flood accepted the nomination in a brief address iu which he feelingly aud eloquently expressed his sense of the great honor conferred upon him, an honor that was the more highly appreci ated because it had been bestowed without any solicitation on his part and then iu a clear and forcible style outlined his general views upon the important questions that would come before the constitution al convention. Col. L. S. Marye, who was pres ent, yielded to repeated calls of the convention, and made a brief ad dress expressing the great gratifica tion he felt in this high honor con ferred upon his young and talented friend, Mr. Flood. Ho declared that the work to which his young friend was about to be called, that of framing an organic law and chart of government, was the highest and noblest task that could engage the powers of the human intellect. The convention thereupon ad journed with every manifestation of the cordiality, good feeling and enthusiasm which characterized its deliberations. ____"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["R", "b", "Poore"], "snippet": "was chosen secretary.

It was about 2 p. m. when the remainig crowd was sum moned into the courthouse, with Messrs. S. L. Ferguson and N. W. Owen as officers of the meeting, to consider the question of whether the County Court system should be dis placed for the District Courts, as provided for by the report of the committee in the Constitutional Con vention. Messrs. J . W. Flood, 8 . L. Fergu son, R. B. Poore and A. H. Clement took part in the discussiou, Messrs. Flood and Ferguson favoring the retention of the County Court and Messrs. Poore and Clement favoiing the report of the committee, which committee would give Appomattox a court every other month, with Judge Hundley on the bench. It is true, if the committees report is adopted by the Convention, we would lose Judge Christian as our county judge so would every other counu lose its judge. . It is but far to the gentlemen who desire to retain the old County Court to admit that it affords a tine opportunity for trading, exchanging views, and learning of each others fortunes aul misfortunes every MOftsl.Viit it Utails a great expense upon toe whole county to maintain this system of sociability, when so few people avail themselves of its exquisite joys and exuberation. If we may be permitted to view the matter from a personal stand point, the County Court is far better for us in every wayas a lawyer, courts come oftener and there are more chances for court ousiuess as a newspaper, the system affords a monthly pay-day for our patrons to come in and pay up aud subscribe, and tell us the news. Again, the merchants here, and in fact the en tire town, no doubt favors the sys temfor the very reasons which we have stated. it is our humble and candid opinion that the judiciary of the State of Virginia will be grea ly benefited, and the expenses greatly- reduced, by abolishing the Courts. Aud, although those present Court day, by a large majority, voted for the resolutions offered by Supt. Haunah requesting Delegate Flood to oppose the abolishment of County Courts, we trust he will not do so, because this meeting was not called for this purpose, and it had no right to instruct our delegate iu the Con vention, who represents not only the entire county of Appomattox but the people of Campbell as well. Mr. Flood knows the situation, has heard the discussion of the question in the Convention, and surely the people can trust him to do the right thing in the matter. Our people should not seek to tie the delegates hands in this manner. He has not asked for instructions dont bind him to vote against his ripe judgment, experience, and con victions.
