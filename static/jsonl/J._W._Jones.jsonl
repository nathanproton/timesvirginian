James Lyons were appointed a committee to inform Judge Moss of I - he action of the meeting, and the Judge came forwa-d and in a few well chosen remarks thanked the bar and the meeting for the expres sions of confidence and esteemed the resolutions contained. Whereas our English ancestors rod their decendants in America have for nearly a thousand years had i court of tbe shire, or county court for hearing and determining the minor controversies of the people, a court especially intended for the masses of small means to save them from journeys and heavy expense, nd whereas such local tribunal is t great convenience to them and either it or some substitute will be necessary for letting to bail, ap pointment of guardians and person- 1 representatives, probate of wills tnd etc., therefore Resolved, by this mass-meeting  -f citizens of Buckingham county, held at this December connty court, 1903, that we regret the change in the, constitution abolishing this court. 2nd.  That in severing our rela tions with the incumbent, Judge John R.

Le- Sneur  Bro., applicants for liquor license at lpha, which was opposed by a large petition to the Judge, ask ing that license be not granted. The Jndge continued the case, and ren dered an opinion, in which he said he had rather the new Court would pais upon the application for . li cense when there is objection. J. A. Trent ws granted  license to sell liquor near Arvonia, there being no opposition to him. Peter Coles, of Albemarle, and Mr. Addie Spencer were hunting at New Store last week.

Immediately in frontof the chancel was an arch of flowers, from the centre of which was suspended a floral design in the shape of a horseshoe with the inscription! Good tu c k . It was under this the young couple stood to plight their troth, the Gne to the other.

The bride, witlfher sister,Miss Minnie Plunkett, as maid of honor, came down the left isle, and the groom, with his best man, Mr. L. H. Gilliam, came down the right, and met under the arch, where they were declared man and wife in a solemn and impressive man ner by the Rev. Mr. Royall, of the Baptist Church. The arrangement of the bridal party abont the altar, the mellow lights and profuse decorations creat ed a scene of beauty rarely witnessed. The Bride was becomingly attired in a white surah silk, en train, a tulle veil caught up by a diamond brooch. A bouquet of Mar\u00e9chal Neil roses, tied with white satin ribbon, was carried in her hand. The bridesmaids were air attired in white silk, wifh natural flowers, the gfoomsmen in conventional black. After the ceremony was over ,the bridal pgrty, together with other in vited guests, repaired to the residence of Mrs. D. P. Robertson, mother of the groom, where a reception was tendered them. There was also present the bridal party of Mr. Robert G. Robertson, another son who had been married that morning in Amherst county. After a season of merry-making among the yonng folks, and on the part of the older ones, indulging in reminiscences of similar scenes in which they were the central figures, the assembled party was invited into supper. And such a supper ! A long table, a d o r n e d with flowers, in the centre of which was a large floral pyramid. It was laden with the choicest viands, and beg gars description. . Suffice it to say that it was an old-time Virginia spread,! which the guests did ample justice.

He took the case from its very beginning and brought down every possible point in order and made out of the whole a terrific arraignment of the prisoner at the bar. At times bis denunciation of the crime, and of the criminal, was awful. As a prosecutor, Mr. Hubbard is unsur passed.
