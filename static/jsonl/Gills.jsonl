But not for a moment was he sorry that he had cast In his lot with the dancing barrel. On board the Lance they were pull ing, discouraged and heartsick. The rope came in so easily th at they knew the dory could not be at its end. The probability was that Dixon had been unable to reach the buoy, and was drifting to leeward In his boat. It was more than doubtful if they ever saw him again. Dixoh felt th at he could hold on but little longer. Jhe power of thought had nearly been beaten out of him. He seemed to have been dragged for hours through the swash of the sea. His body was numbed al most to paralysis. A dozen times he had imagined the schooners light in the gloom to windward, but had found himself mistaken. He was pos sessed by a dull conviction that he would never reach her. An unwonted smoothness of the sea surprised himi He raised his head, and there, not thirty feet away, shone the lantern in the Lances fore rigging. As her deck rolled down, he saw the swaying line of weary men heaving in the rope. At the same instant they caught sight of him, and gave a shout of surprise and joy. Very carefully the last few feet were coiled in, until willing arms hauled him over the rail. Tucked in a bunk near the stove and filled with hot coffee, he tdld re gretfully of the record-breaking fish he had lost. At the end of his story two men went out. Presently they returned, carrying by the gills the biggest cod he had ever set eyes on. It was considerably over five feet long. Stand up, Chris! they shouted to a wiry little Cape Verde Islander, Suspended glistening in the lamp light, the monstdr came almost to the top of the Portuguese fishermans head. As Dixon looked, the bitter ness of loss went out of his heart. Good boy, Chris! said he. Im glad you got him. I dont feel halt so bad about losing mine, sined he couldnt have won the prize.

In France Jnst now this Is more than a question of gustatory Interest The price of the little fishes has fallen so low that the discouraged fishermen and cannery workers of Brittany, the worlds chief source of sardines, are threatening Bolshevism, and have even elected commissars of the peo ple, according to press dispatches. Brittany and its leading Industry are the subjects of the following bulletin from Washington D. C. headquar ters of the National Geographic so ciety. For more reasons than one- Brit tany might be called the Ireland of France,  says the bulletin. The Bretons are Celts, cousins of the Irish. They have the same Interest in things of the spirit, and the same tendency, on occasion, to emotional outbursts. For centuries, too, they had the same antagonism toward outside rule that so long animated the Irish. For 1,500 years they fought successfully against Roman, Norman, English and French, for the Independence of Brittany. They managed to keep a parliament of their own until the French revolu tion. Has Frances Beat Harbors. Today Brittany has no political ex istence, and is not even represented on many maps. It occupies the spout of the French teapot. the western most peninsula of France, the north ern coast of which forms the south ern mouth of the English channel. This land, about the size of Maryland, was formerly Armorica, but got its present name during the Fifth and Sixth centuries because of the heavy Immigration of Britons, driven from across the channel by the Angles and Saxons. It is a rough country, cov ered with rocks and hills and semi mountains. Its coast line Is deeply Indented, and has the best harbors in France. This fact and the existence of large numbers of fish offshore, - turned the eyes of the Bretons sea ward. They are Frances greatest fishermen and her chief reliance as material for her navy and merchant marine. Many sorts of fish and sea food are taken in Brittany waters, but by far the leading product Is the sardine. Brittanys sardine industry began to develop in 1845 when the first can nery was built. This was not long after the preservation of food prod ucts by canning had been placed on a sound basis. Now there are more than 200 canneries in the region. The sar dine fishermen number 30,000 or more, and some 20,000 workers, mostly girls and women, are engaged in the pack ing industry The prosperity of Brittany binges on the Uttle fish, and it is fickle tn its favors. Some years there will be practically none in the offshore wa ters, and as many as four poor years have followed one another. When this happens there is real suffering at times 80,000 people have been prac tically on the verge of starvation, and the French government has bad to lend a hand. The sardines are taken in nets in the meshes of which they are caught by their gills. It is necessary, how ever, to use large quantities of bait, salted cod eggs. When a school of sardines appears near a fishing boat, bait is thrown beyond the dangling net, and the little fishes rushing for the falling food, are snared in the meshes. The net is then lifted aboard and the fish gently shaken out. The fishing takes place near shore and often the fish are in the canneries within an hour or so after they are taken from the water. The fishermen sell by the thousand, according to size, the larger fish bring ing the best price. Brices range from one dollar to five per thousand ac cording to conditions. The cannery workers go through a complicated procedure. They cleun and behead the little flsnes, sonk them in brine, dry them in wire baskets, Immerse the baskets of fishes in boiling oil, pack the sardines in tin boxes, pour in oil, seal the boxes, and finully boll them in huge cauldrons of water for two hours. The boxes are then labeled and are ready for market . Prehistoric Monuments. Inland Brittany Is an agricultural ! country, but much of the land Is in fertile. There are numerous wild i moorlands. On these are some of the 1 most interesting prehistoric remains found in Europe, the rough stone , monuments of the early Celts. Huge stones have been stood on end. These are known as menhirs. When they have been placed in circles or arcs as in the British Stonehenge made also by Celts at about the same time they are called cromlechs. When the . great upright stones support horizon-  tal ones they are dolmens. The most ! striking of these monuments are the 1 alignments of menhirs.  The early Celts are supposed to ibave erected the stones in connection ! with their religious rites, and appar ently the great Carnac alignment was I a sort of Mecca and a holy burial 1 place. Keystones in the cromlechs j were oriented with regard to certain  seasonal positions of the sun. This  has furnished a clew for astronomers i and archeologists working together, 1 and they have computed the approxi mate building date of the oldest mon uments at 2000 B. C. The latest of the monuments were probably erected during the first century, B. C."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["gills"], "snippet": "are caught by their <mark>gills</mark>.
