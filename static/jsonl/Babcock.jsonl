Y .Preaching at the Irving Square Presbyterian Church on the theme, The Life Spiritual in Christ the Fundamental in Chris tianity, the Rev. Ira Wemmell Hen derson, pastor, took as his text John 35 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. He said It is my desire, as the Spirit may give me wisdom, to unfold to you what, to my mind, is the fundamental in Christianity. From the words of our Master I conceive the truth to be that, save as we apprehend the spiritual verities revealed in Jesus Christ save as -e see the world, man, our God, with the spiritual vis ion, we cannot become partakers of the glories of the kingdom of our Father. Only as we open our hearts and minds to the indwelling Spirit of Almighty God do we enter into the promised land of the new dispensa tion, to possess it, to enjoy it. Filled with the Spirit we, live, but if the Spirit of God abide not in a man he Is none of His. In that beautiful figure of the vine Christ cuts clear for us the nature of the spiritual life. It is our oneness within the Author of the universe and of us. It is the merging of our lives Into the life of God. The perfect spiritual life expresses itself in union within the Maker. Entirely within the lining Christ moves the flawless human. Fashion a man according to the stature of Jesus Christ and you have a spiritual man. The spiritual life is that life within Christ which will make you always ask, What would Jesus do? The ethical judg ment always referring for its sanction to the spiritual. Spirituality and godliness are syn onymous. Apart, from the glorified Nazarene there is, Christianly speak ing. no spiritual existence. Spiritual ity is no mere statement of philoso phy it is a fact. A vital and a vivi fying reality Is the life within the Son of Man. The Christ, life is not merely a state of mind, but a mode of action. The living of the man within Jesus and for the Father, and the Holy Spirit dwelling in him, that Is the life spiritual. As the late Or. plaltbie D. Babcock well said  Spir ituality is seeing God in common things and showing God in common things. Now this spiritual life is not eso teric in its nature. It Is not a life for the few. It is a life for us alt. The economy of the good news of the Master is worldwide in its application and inclusiveness. To all men the opportunity to dwell within Christ is offered. To ail the higher life has its appeal. From Nlcodemus of the San hedrim, to Oneslmua the slave. From the mighty in intellect, to the unlet tered and unlearned. To the banker, to the beggar, without money and Without price, are given all the wealth at Gods command if they will.
