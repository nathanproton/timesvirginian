Three masked men held up the Oregon Ex press, Southbound on the Southern Pacific railroad, at Copley, near Kes wick, killed W. J. O Neil the express messenger, and carried ofif the con tents of the express box. The train is known as No. IS, and stopped at Copley, a small station, for water. As the train came to a standstill, three men jumped on and cut the train in two, taking the engine and express car down the track a short distance. They stopped the engine and de manded that Messenger O Neil open the express car. He refused, where upon they blew open the car with dynamite and deliberately killed O Neil by shooting him throught the head. The bandits then robbed the car of its contents, but it is not known how much they obtained. After robbing the express car the men cut the car loose, and, getting on Ihc engine compelled Engineer Joesink to go ahead. When near Keswick the men dropped off the engine and dis appeared with their plunder. Engineer B. F. Joesink then ran his engine to Redding to take back Sheriff Richardson and a posse _ of eight men. Joesink says that after stopping at Copley the noise of draw ing water drowned the noise of shots that must have been fired in the ex press car, as W. J. O Neil, the mes senger, was killed by bullets. Pre sumably the three masked men at tempted to rob the express car and the messenger made a fight. The first that Joesink knew of o f the hold up was after O Neil was killed. He and his fireman, J. F. Stury, were com pelled to dismount. Thqy, with E. A. Bissell, engineer of the second en gine! A. A. Raymond, a fireman, John Dcpanger, conductor of the train and a brakeman, were compelled to march back to the express car, where they saw O Neil dead. The robbers tried to force O Neills helper, who was in the baggage car when O Neill was killed, to open the safe, but the helper showed that he could not do sot The robbers com pelled the party of seven to place six sticks of giant powder on top of the safe. Then they had a heavy box set on the dynamite, to which a fuse was ordered attached. All but one of the robbers then left the car. He lighted the fuse. The party had just reached the locomotive when the explosion oc curred. It wrecked the entire car. Engineer Joesink is not certain that the robbers got any plunder. He was made to get upon his engine and stay there until further orders caine for him to carry the highwaymen south. The robbers stood at his back on the trip down, their rifles pressing against him, and he dared not look around. If they had any plunder he did not see it. They told him they wanted to be carried to Keswick Station, five miles south, but as they neared that station they told the engineer to run right on by that station to a point 200 yards south of there, where a bridge spans the river. When he stopped they alighted on the river side.
