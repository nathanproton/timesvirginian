Supervisors had rejected prelimi nary plans for the project -at their - March meeting, citing problems with design of the  complex, and the possibility of using an existing su bsidized-housing plan to meet the needs of moderate incomefamilies in Appomattox. In March, the supervisors heard a report from Watkins Abbitt, Jr., who said that his housing committee did not feel the income range specified for renters of the apartments - 7,200 to 15,600 - was low and moderate in this county. Abbitt also said the preliminary design for the apartments would not accomodate elderly and handicapped pel-sons, as many of the units Would be accessible only by steps. Representatives from Bradley and Trinkle, a Roanoke-based development firm hoping to gain approval for the project, explained that tne apartments would not be rent-subsidized, and that eight of the 48 units would lui f accessible to the handicapped. Tom Trinkle, of the developers, noted that there had been an apparent misunderstanding between the Super visors and Greater Boston Develop ment, Inc., a Massachusetts firm which originally subm itted the apartment complex proposal. Abbitt said that he felt the board had been misled, and board members .requested that the plans, including sp\u00e9cifications for renter eligibility, be submitted again fer consideration. . In other business, board members heard a request from Mr. and Mrs. Nugene Harvey, owners and operators of the Southside Country Club on Route 460 west of the. town of Appomattox, for an amendment to an ordinance regulating nightclubs. They asked the supervisors for an amendment which would allow their and h er simil establishment to stay open until 2 a.m., rather than 1 a.m. on weekends, as stipulated in the ordinance. Mr. Harvey noted that the ely closing time was hurting his business, since many of his patrons work late and dont get off from work in time to get to the establishment before it closes. Commonwealths A ttorney Sam Kerr noted that the board could advertise proposed change in the ordinance regulating such establish ments and base their decision on public input.
