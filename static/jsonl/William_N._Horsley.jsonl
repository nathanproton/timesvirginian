The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

The peaches seem to be killed, but the apple blooms are, most of them alive at this writing. Mr. Jas. Murphy says when the fruit year is at hand there will be fruit no matter how cold it gets. A writer in a recent number of an agricultural paper claims that his boy raised 5 per cent, out of 60 tnrkeys, but I can go him two bet ter than that, one of Buckinghams noted turkey raisers raised 74 out of 75 in one flock, and this spring she has 15 turkey hens laying and I shouldnt wonder if she raises 200 head this time. Mrs. Wiley Mornss and Mrs. William Horner have been on a visit to their parents, Mr. and Mrs. L D. Jones at New Store the past week. Judge John R. Moss attended Cumberland court looking after his political fences. All ladies are allowed to change their minds and the date for hold ing the High School final has been changed to the 9th of May. The pupils have been well drilled in the parts they are to take and unless some of them are Stage Struck we are to have a nice entertainment. The Ladies Aid Society and the Junior Society of the Presbyterian Church will serve refreshments, and the whole entertainment will be in the conrt house building. Mrs. LewiB Cabell continues with her mother at Rock Cliff, and it is thought that Mrs. Eliza Horsley is improving. Judge Horsley is probably back from his European trip as he was to sail last week.  . The two colored men in jail here charged with setting fire to Elcan and Smiths houses claim that there can be no evidence against them, and that they made no admissions to the negro detective, who caused their arrest. The crime of arson is one that oft n goes unpunished in this county. We read of new potatoes, toma toes, squash, and other vegetables on the Norfolk market, but when we read of 7.50 a barrel for pota toes we only wish we had them to sell. I paid 50c. a bushel for some old ones. The daily papers say board at the hotels and boarding houses at and adjacent to Jamestown is from 3.50 to 20 a day, or rather the expenses one may readily incur in a day there would reach 20. Tiieee near  M o furnish provisions should reap iiUvest this summer. Eggs went up to 19c. a dozen in one day when the great gnn boats anchored in Hampton Roads. There was a killing in Campbell one week and not many days later a killing in Nelson, and a writer in one of the city papers asks,  What is the matter. There is  a heap  in the papers now about the  un written law, and in a St. Louis conrt a Judge discharged a panel of 50 men who were summoned for jury service, becanse they said if the accused should plead the un written law they would acquit him. I dont know whether when this un written law is written, it will be to license men to slay their fellows or not, bat if this so called unwritten law is as variously defined as seems to have been the case in the courts"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["n"], "snippet": "u c k i <mark>n</mark> g h a m"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["n"], "snippet": "u c k i <mark>n</mark> g h a m"}], "text_match": 1731669220158079097, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1116681273344", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1731669220158079097", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
