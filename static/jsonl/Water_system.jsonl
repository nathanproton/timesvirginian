From her mother she received training In keeping with the Ideals advocated by Mrs. Stanton, and she believed that woman was intended to play a more important and useful part in the scheme of civilization than she does at present.

The project, mostly funded by a HUD block grant, would include a water storage tank and foundation and part of a water line to the storage tank. Additional funds will be needed and a local public works application has been sent in for funds. Assuming it is approved, work is to begin within 90 days. If and when the project is advertised for bids it will be in two parts one, storage tank and two, water line. . Council approved the May- Hines request.

Usually, the farm family that does not have running water available looks upon it as a luxury, but the family that has made this improve ment invariably finds it an indis pensable necessity. Although no ac curate figures on the subject are available at this time, it is doubtful if more than 15 per cent of Vir ginia farms have running water un der pressure, even in the farm home. It is the remaining 85 per cent that I hope wdl be interested in the following remarks relative to the farm water supply. It should be the Tim and hope of  every rural resident to sometime have running water and hence the sanitary facilities it makes possible. There are many combinations of equipment that can be used to pro vide running water on liny farm and at a lower cost than is usually anticipated. It is tine that the necessary pumping quipmen plus complete plumbing end bath room facilities may cost several hundred dollars. St should be remembered, however, that the entire job need not be done at one time oi within one year. In fact, it is sometimes more desirable to the job a step at a time. In this way the running water often provides means of increasing the farm income so that the remain der of the system will bo more easily financed. One should not lose sight of the fact that any money spent on the farm water supply and the installation of plumb ing equipment represents a perma nent improvement that1 will always mean an increased property value. Running water not only saves the average housewife the average of 30 10-hour days of the drudgery of. pumping and carrying water hut i. provides many other advantages for the - farm family. The clean protect ed supply of water, plus improved sanitation facilities make for better health. An abundant supply of wa ter for the poultry and livestock always increased the inconfe from these farm enterprises. Small scale irrigation of the family garden in creases home produced food sup plies, especially in .drought years, thereby reducing the amount of money necessary to spend for these things. Just the other day a fanner commented that his house was des troyed by fire in 1931. He installed an electric water system for his new home and the saving in lower fire insurance rates has not only paid all the cost of operating the pump but has gone a long way toward paying for the water system. This, in addition to all the other advan tages. Remember that any type water system should be carefully planned and installed so that a life-time of service can be expected from it.  Each farm has problems to be tak en into consideration that are un like any other farm. Therefore, ex- pert advice should be secured in planning this important improve ment. If you would like to have a survey made of your water supply problem with free suggestions for getting running water on your farm request this service through your cjounty agent today.

Binger, commissioner of public works in Manhattan, who re cently returned from London by bomber. Mr. Binger, who is the chairman of the national technolog ical civil protection committee, had been in London since September 4, 1940, preparing a confidential report for the wpr department on engineer ing aspects of civilian defense. I went to London armed with a battery of questions to ask the most eminent engineers in that country concerning such subjects as protec tive conditions against bombs, de fense against air attacks, blackouts, supervision of water supply, and defense qgainst air attacks. I must admit that most of my report is confidential but there is still a lot I can say of interest to the Amer ican popplace, he commented. In London I was guided by a representative of the Institute of Civil Engineers to see the work the engineers were doing. In this way I was not hampered by government officials. For example, the chief engineer of one of the biggest rail roads in the country conducted me to the main points damaged by bombs. Railroad Often Bombed. This particular railroad line has received about one-half of all the attacks of German bombers on rail road line in England. Due to the advance preparations the line has never been halted long enough to cause serious trouble. This is made possible by ad vance preparations. All along the line emergency stations are set up. They are fully equipped with men and machinery to get to the scene of the bombing and repair all darm age. A bridge which carried the main traffic of four lines was al most totally wiped out, but in 24 hours one of the lines was travel ing over it on schedule. Another reason for Englands re markable stand against bombing at tacks is that their repairs are made on a permanent basis instead of temporary. Mr. Binger declared that all the streets in London are in almost perfect condition. The gas and water supplies are functioning as in peace time. Water System Savior. Many engineers before the was scoffed at the water piping system in London, he went on. They thought it was obsolete, but this obsolete water system was a savior. Due to the many cross pipes and cross sections of the piping sys tem the enemy bombers could never make a death blow at Londons wa ter supply. In this respect London is luckier than New York. A unique use of the cellars of bombed houses was described by Mr. Binger. When a house is de molished by a bomb the debris is cleared away. The cellar is cleaned and lined with rubber. When this is accomplished water is piped into the cellar and it is used as a reser voir. There are now 150 such reser voirs in London. The largest holds a half million gallons of water. Engineers in London are planning to build 800 more of them. One of the reasons a factory is able to recover so quickly after a bombing is because of the 300,000 tarpaulins stored by the ministry of aircraft production, he said. I Immediately after a bombing these tarpaulins are put over all open machinery and windows."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Water", "System"], "snippet": "as in peace time. <mark>Water</mark> <mark>System</mark> Savior.

New Canton.After the lapse of five weeks since the severe frosts of April, it has been ascertained, after careful examination of many orchards in this section, that the damage done to all kinds of fruit exceeded the first cal culations. Commercially, the apple crop is practically a failure. Locally, the delicious apples seem to have escaped with the least damage, while winesaps suffered a heavy loss. The Boatwright Orchards at Gold Hill suf fered less than any orchard in this section, owing to its high location. The crop there will possibly exceed 3t per cent. The orchards of A. L. Pitts, at Arvonia, and of Plummer F. Jones, in New Canton, contain about 10 per cent. of a crop.
