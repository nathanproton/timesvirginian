They were in formed with an indifferent smile, that they had other important du ties and home affairs claiming their time, and their quarters could be better spent elsewhere than on the dead. In one seuse this is true. We have home duties and try not to neglect them, aud the monev ould be possibly more wisely spent While we do this to honor our dead, we try also to impress npo. the minds of the children of the county, hat the Confederate cause was just .ml right and thatthir fathers were not rebellious traitors and to give them a desire to acquire knowledge of the events of their country, and to teach, them to be patriotic aud proud of their South-land and an cestors. The little knowledge, be ginning here may grow in the minds and hearts of each, and be of great benefit to all. The president of the U. D. C. thought last year of giviug up the charter of the Appo mattox Chapter U. D. C. on account of the ladies lack of interest in this county. She wrote the National l D. C. president, and the Virginia president U. D. C. to that effect, stating she would join a chapter in Lynchburg. Letters from the Va. division, S. C. division and Md. di vision came pouring in not to let Appomattox surrender the second time also sending a list of names of prominent ladies who would join among them, Miss Ruth Early, Mrs. James Garnett, Miss M. Amelia Smith, the piesideut of Va. division U. D. C. and the daughter of ex-Gov Wm. Smith of Va., known as Ex tra Billy. The letter expressed surprise at the Appomattox ladies not caring to join one of the largest organizations m the whole south and living in one of the most his torical counties in the world. It is quite a reflection upon the county. We revised the roll and now have ouly eighteen members lu t they say they intend to keep up the or ganization and to be proud they are U. O C. of Appomattox and we shall be more than pleased if Coal ing will forward us the names ot the ladies desiring to join the IT, D.

W. Hunter, president of U. D. C. West Appomattox. One prominent aim of the U. D. C. is to gather histori cal facts to help the historians of the U. D. 0. historical committee in collecting war experiences, inci dents and reminiscences of the old soldiers, their wives, daughters or any one who can remember during the Civil war. The U. D. C. es pecially requests, Mrs. T. W. Johns to write up hers and Capt. Johns also Mrs. George Miles, Mrs. A. H. Bocock, Major Flood, Mr. Chap Chilton, Drs. Wm. White and Wm. H. Ahbitt, Mrs. Mary Ann Robert son, Mr. Kirk Hannah and any one who will help us, also send us news paper clippings or Magazines or Journals or anything bearing on the war between the states. This is to help in having a correct history of the south. Please dont think yours will not be of service or interest for it may show up the spirit of the times more than you think.

One has to give onl impressionistic views, because censorship prevents any of uf from knowing what actually h going on. Father Darkleaf i enough of a journalist to know that. So our personal impres sions the anti-Jewish demon trations and persecutions we read of, I guess to be exagger ated and fed us to arouse Anti- Hitler sentiment. If the wai lords want you and I to fight Germany again, they will have their artists paint pla cards of Hitlerites butchering innocent cantors and Semetic babes. Further, what right has France to fuss about any body else arming? Gftman reparations helped pay for Frances present bristling arm ies. What would you do if you were German . . .all your neighbors armed a n d waiting an excuse to jump on you . . . and stripped of all means of de fending yourself legally . . . wouldnt you carry a razor in your sock? I am not a Ger man sympathist or apologist, but when Hitler says, It is not wise to rob people of their eco nomic means of existence with out taking into account their right to live and Germany wants nothing she is not will ing to give to others, then I say, these are not bad words.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight.
