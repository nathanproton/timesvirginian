Oh yes. Gilbert Mays lov\u00e9s his honey.....and the approxi mately \u00cf75 hives of bees that produce that honey. . Mays has a fascinating avocation, beekeeping. Hes been at it for approximately fifty years. His late grandmot her Moiti\u00e9 Mays, who inciden tally lived to be 102, raised bees in a nail keg. Whenever the bees swarmed and she had to get them in a hive, she would call her grandson, Gilbert and he would , come and help her. From the early age of six or seven he became more and more interested in the art of beekeeping. Beekeeping is just what the name suggests the man merely keeps the busy little be\u00ebs...Al- though they may live in his hive, he, in no way owns them. In a most independent manner they go about their business pollinating the  flowers and giving-honey for man to enjoy. If the bees wanted, they could easily swarm away from a particular hivnand relocate somewhere else but not only are they industrious, they are smart. If the beekeeper is doing his job property they know their surroundings are good and they will stay there. Man, in a sense, may manipulate the bees, but he is not able to improve on their work or further glorify the results of their efforts. Bpes are efficient, loyal, handworking and even rather intelligent, despite their tiny size. Cont rary to popular belief, they are quite docile. Beekeeping and honey prod uction go hand in hand with the miraculous cycle of nature. No day for beekeeper Gilbert Mays is ever quite the same. His avocation holds a fascina tion as no other hobby could do. He is constantly rewarded by his efforts. The modern beehive is a series bf boxes stacked atop one another inside each of these boxes hang frames in which the bees build their hexagonal-cell- ed combs. The bottom sets of boxes are actually working and living areas for the colony bf bees all the boxes stacked above called supers are placed there by the beekeeper for the bees to fill with honey. Three types of bees live in the colony the queen bee, the drones, and the worker bees. The queen bee, which lives fortwo or three years, exists primarily to My - eggs. She . mates only onee, and is then capable of laying 1500 or more eggs every toy until her death. She is the center of attention for the hive when she is nearby, all the other bees exhibit a particularly excited behavior. They feed her, raise1 her young, mid protect her. When she d\u00ef\u00e9, without warning, the rest of the colony actually makes Sa audible wailing sound that they make t no, other tu\u00efj.

Psalm 9-17. The many things going on in our community and Nation, that are absurd and ridiculous that the majority of our people do not want, and most certain ly do not approve, a three mil lion dollar school, the taxpay ers, said No, the Supervisors, skyrocketing our taxes, for what will never bring about Quality Education. Funda mental down to earth Educa tors declare that mixing the races can never improve education, but lower or destroy it to both races. The next most ridiculous and unnecessary proposal by this Commonwealth, is a three mil lion dollar Highway by-pass to kill Historic Appomattox, just like they killed Pamplin, the only other major town in Appomattox County, with a very unnecessary by-pass, which has also been a death trap. No small town needs a by-pass, they need all the outside traffic they can get, all they need is to maintain a four-lane Highway through the towns, with proper lights where necessary, with only a fraction of the cost of unnecessary by-passes. The larger cities need by-passes, but they are unessential and absolutely unnecessary for small towns, to site an instance of the need of a by-pass, my wife, and I returning for West Virginia, recently, thru Staun ton saw the need, a large city as that is, has no bypass, you have to wind around all the way thru the city to get to Interstate 81. There a by-pass is essential and needed, but I hear of none being proposed for that large city, where the need is great. When will our leaders ever wake up to the facts, that we, taxpayers do not want our money spent on such useless and unnecessary projects? Another even more absurd proposal by this Common wealth, is to construct a new bridge and road in a slight new location, across the Norfolk and Western Railroad, on se condary road 635. The old bridge could be strengthened and widened, or removed entirely, detouring the traffic, and a new one put in approximately the same loca tion and with safety to the public, if common sense were exercised. I received a letter from the Virginia Highway Department stating the road bed of this proposed new bridge will be nine 9 feet higher than the roadbed of the present bridge. Think of approximate 9 foot fill on each end of this bridge, with the short distance on the North from main Highway 460, such an unreasonable rise in elevation will make it virtually unsafe for any traffic in the winter, or even when the road is wet, wheh entering 460 would be almost impossible to stop for on-coming traffic, yet they are proposing to trans port our school children to the new school referred to earlier, over this high bridge and road, in my judgment, it is beyond human comprehension that"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Highway", "460"], "snippet": "the North from main <mark>Highway</mark> <mark>460</mark>, such an unreasonable rise"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Highway", "460"], "snippet": "the North from main <mark>Highway</mark> <mark>460</mark>, such an unreasonable rise"}], "text_match": 1157451471441100921, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2211897868288", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1157451471441100921", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Somehow or other he didnt relish the thought of having to explain that kind of landlady to his wife not that she had ever had anything to worry about, but why rock the boat? Suddenly he thought,. This is sheer nonsense, TO just call, make an appointment, and see for myself. With a hesitant manner, he dialed the number. After just a few rings, the young man heard a soft, hello at the other end of the line. It definitely was not the voice of a cantankerous old lady, nor was it the voice of a sexy siren! It was a lovely voice, gentle, but at the same time with a suggestion of strength. Was he relived! He made an appoint ment for the next evening and he felt sure he would not be disappointed. He was not, he met a lovely lady. A vistor looking for the home of Mama Rach, M rs. Rachel F . Law son, on Lee Street, Appomattox, would find a big two story house with wide front porch. The house, like the inhabitant has about it an friendly air, it sort of seems to say, welcome, come on in. Rachel Ferguson Lawson, a daughter of the late State Senator, Samuel L . Ferguson, and Adelia Mann Ferguson, was born and reared in Appomattox County. Her birth place was The Brickhouse on highway 460 just west of , Appom attox.  The Brick- I house, as it was known to everyond, was built by Rachels  father on the land acquired j shortly after he reached manhood. It had once been 1 known as the old Robertson  farm home and later the Martin j farm. The Fergusons lived in the j Brickhouse until 1913 when j they moved to Courtland, the family home on Court Street in the town of Appomattox. Courtland, a story-book home, was begun in 1911, completed in 1913, and dis mantled in 1970. Incidentally, Mama Rach has in her back yard a gazebo, made entirely of wood and brick from the family home, Courtland. The beautiful home, often called a mansion, with the impressive name of Court- land consisted of 32 rooms, four complete bathrooms, three floors above the ground and boasted an elevator. Rachel laughingly recalled the very first night the family hspfij3U-ip y  nejhJp3fe E iiry th iij and they -were so proud oM t A ll of the bathrooms were gleam ing white. One, however, did not remain that way for long. Rachel had a dog, a white poddle named Rooney.
