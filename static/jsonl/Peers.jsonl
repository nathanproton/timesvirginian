Inspired utterances express regret at the inability to maintain neutrality, but say that Great Britain,, the ally of Japan, Is compelled to defend herself against the aggressions of Germany. Moreover, it Is pointed out that Ger many is making preparations day and night at Kiauchau, where it is storing provisions, while its warships are scouring the seas of Eastern Asia, to the great detriment of commerce, and that its converted cruisers are seizing English merchant vessels. Such actions, It is argued, are direct ly calculated to disturb the peace of Eastern Asia, and accordingly, after full and frank communication with Great Britain, Japan has found her self compelled to send an ultimatum to Germany."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["peers"], "snippet": "Premier, Sunday invited the <mark>peers</mark>, the newspaper men and"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["peers"], "snippet": "Premier, Sunday invited the <mark>peers</mark>, the newspaper men and"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Mr. Hors ley last Week resigned the position of private secretary to Congressman Flood, which oarried a salary of 1, 200 per annum paid by Congress and assumed the management of the Southside Virginian.

Seldom has a death of a member of our community affected everyone so sadly as that of Mrs. Lelia McKin ney, wife of Mr. Frank W. McKin ney. The announcement of her death and its suddenness sent a shock through the entire community. On Monday last she was taken very ill at about 11 oclock at night, and the conditions being very alarming,riders were sent out in all directions for physicians. Drs. W. H. Abbitt and A. A. Rice were found and promptly responded to the summons. They did all that was possible to alleviate her sufferings and to tide her over the dangerous illness, but when the evening shades of Tuesday began to fall, Mrs McKinney passed away. The hour of her death was 5 oclock Many of her friends were telegraphed for from Lynchburg and Richmond and among those who came by the earliest train were Mr. and Mrs. Wal ter McKinney,Mrs. Poore, of Lynch burg, and Mr. Charles Peers, of Rich mond. The funeral services, which oc curred yesterday at 4 oclock, were conducted by Rev. E. M. Craig, as sisted by Rev. W. S. Royall. The re mains of the deceased were interred in the old family cemetery, just the rear of the house. A very large number of friends and relatives were present to witness the last sad rites. Mrs. McKinney was a native of Appomattox, having passed her life, until a few months ago, at OldAp- pomattox Court-House. She was a daughter of Mr. Geb. Peers, our pre sent county clerk. She was married only last May, and at the time of her death was thirty-three years of age. She was a member of the Presby terian church, and her character as a Christian and as a womanwas sfffih that it would be almost an intrusion to touch upon it.
