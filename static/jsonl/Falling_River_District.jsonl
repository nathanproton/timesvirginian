Later, the 208 Basin Plans were prepared for both the Roanoke and Jam es, River Basins and the tfbwn was insistent upon maintaining the original stream classification and regional plan for Appomat tox. In March 1975, Councilman Spiggle and W. S. Slagle appeared before the State W ater Control Board in Richmond and made a strong plea for early funding of the proposed Appomattox regional sewage treatment plant. In the summer of 1975 the Town was notified that it would, upon application, be considered for Step I funding.

When the conservation dis-  trict was organized in 1938, I erosion and stream pollution j were rampant. Local rivers j were said to be too thick to drink and too thin to plow. Reorganized in 1972, the conservation district now en compasses Amherst, Appomat tox, Campbell Counties and Lynchburg. To be effective, conservation measures must be i carefully planned, installed and maintained. Technical assist ance for planning and applying conservation practices is provi ded to the conservation district by the USD A Soil Conservation Service and other conservation agencies. Conservation work in the late 1930s was mostly installing terrace on tobacco land and stabilizing gullies. The war greatly increased the need for wheat, corn and forage crops for dairy and livestock product ion. Contour strip cropping, grassed waterways, pasture and hayland improvement, livestock watering facilities and drainage were the most popular practices. The 1950s and 1960s brought about many land use changes. Cropland was covert ed to grassland and open land to woodland at an unprecedent ed rate. Floods followed by droughts pointed to the need to better manage our water resources. Irrigation ponds were constructed at a record pace. Two water-shed projects, East Fork of Falling River and Little Falling River watershed projects, were completed. Six flood water retarding reservoirs wereconstructed and land throughout the watersheds adequately protected with acclerated application of con servation practices. The decade of the 1970s are presenting many challenges to the conservation efforts. Farm ers are using larger machinery and using cropland more intensively. Conventional con servation systems, such as contour strip cropping and crop rotations, are being abandoned by many to increase  grain acreages.

There has been enmity between the men ever since and but ror the interference of friends there would have been a serious encounter. Work was started on the rehabilitation of the old furnace at Reusens, several miles west of Lynchburg, on the James River division of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. The furnace has passed I to the control of the Southern Develop ment Company, of Philadelphia, which I is to expend 40,000 in the next three months. The furnace will be operated I is soon as possible. To start with, it will have a capacity of 100 tons a day. The trustees of the George M. Jones Memorial Association have accepted the design of Frye  Chesterman, of Lynch- burg, for the 40,000 public library to be erected there by a bequest of George M. Jones. The building is to be of buff pressed brick, with Indiana limestone and terra cotta trimmings. Mrs. Jones has given a valuable site and an endow ment of 50,000. E. E. Walker, of Campbell county, was arrested in Lynchburg by Detective A. D. Williams, charged with burning the barn of S. M. Wisecarver, neat Rust- burg, three months ago. Five horses and other animals were destroyed. Norfolk will secure the annual meet ing of the Southern Wholesale Grocers Association to be held June 5, 6 and 7. President J. A. Van Hoose, of Birming- ham, Ala., writes as much to the Whole sale Grocers and Tobacconists Associa tion of Tidewater. The idea is to hold the convention either at Ocean View or Virginia Beach. Capt. Henry Kirn, the largest truck- raiser in the Norfolk section, estimates that the losses of farmers in Tidewater Vinginia will reach the vast sum of 1,- 000,000. He has individual losses of several thousand dollars. Mr. Kirn in speaking of the matter said that until the frost of a few nights ago there had been hone for four weeks, and crops, particularly strawberries, had had favor able conditions, the blossoms came early and the berries followed and were in fine condition. Mrs. Kelly Breeden, of Rose Hill, Charlottesville, stepped off a moving Main street car with her little son in hfr arms. The boy escaped injury, but it is feared the woman fractured her skull. Norwell Getses, of Boston, engineer on the schooner Catherine M. Monahan, was killed at the coal pier at Newport News. The schooner was being loaded with coal when Getses came on deck. Just as he came out of the campanion way a large lump of coal fell from the pier and crushed in his skull. He leaves a widow and one child in Boston. Charles Best died at Arvonia, Bucking ham county, of injuries received in the slate quarry, a heavy rock falling on him. He was a native of Albemarle county. After hiccoughing almost incessantly for 96 hours Austin T. Quick, a promi nent business man of Lynchburg, has been relieved. There seems to be no doubt now that Mr. Quick will recover speedily. The publication of his trouble brought the family a large number of letters, telegrams and even long-distance telephone messages suggesting remedies for the trouble. Some of these were tried, but they gave no relief. It was decided by the General Hospital Board, in session at Williamsburg, to have all tuberculosis patients in the Eastern and Western Asylums moved to the asylum at Marion.

In view of the meeting early this year of the Constitutional Convention attention has been called to the con- iitfon of the State House, where the sessions of his body will be held. Two resolutions were offered in the Legislature calling attention to this matter. In the Senate Mr. Fairfax, under a suspension of the rules, had adopted a resolution providing for tho appointment of a commission of five to investigate the condition of the old Capitol and if necessary provide a new roof and make other repairs. Archie Hunt, the negro who was jonvicted of the murder of Tom Gills, ilso colored, expiated hils crime on the gallows in the Lynchburg Jail. He was attended by Rev. Father Anciaux, the priest in charge of the colored mission, and Rev. Father McGuire, pastor of the Church of the Holy Cross. Hunt was calm and cool to the end and met his fate with remarkable fortitude. When asked if he had anything to say he answered I am about to be executed for killing a man in self-de fense, and thats all there Is to It. Since he death of three citizens in Stafford county and the narrow escape of 15 others from drinking the vile eoncodtlon known as schnapps, which is being sold in local option district through the State as a substitute for liquor, many heretofore strong advo cates of he local option system are now outspoken for license, as they think it is better for people to drink liquor made in the regular way, if they will persist in using these es sences of poisonous chemicals when they cannot buy whiskey. In the House Mr. Todd, of Augusta, introduced a bill providing capital punishment for whitecappers. This extreme penalty for this crime is pro posed in view of the defiant attitude of some lawless elements in Bedford county recently. These people have in some instances threatened to kill jus tices of the peace and other law offi cers who seek to arrest them for white- capping. There were two bills introduced in the House providing the details for assembling the Constitutional Conven tion. One of these, offered by Mr. Parks, fixes the membership of the convention a t 80, two for each State Senatorial district. The time of meet ing is July 1 and the date of the elec tion and other essential features are similar to the other propositions offer ed at this session.

Raphine, a small station on he edge of Rockbridge, near Augusta line, shipped, during the past year for a firm of cattle dealers, 541 cattle, 177 veal, 1367 sheep and 2946 hogs. The price paid out to the people of that neigh borhood was 46,755.40, or an increase over the amount paid out by same dealers in 1899 of 5000. There was a falling off in number of cattle shipped but an increase In other stock.

In addition to the new hands brought down, a number of the strikers have returned to work at the old scale. About 180 men are now at work. It requires only 200 men to operate the piers fully.

There was indignation in Norfolk on the receipt of the Congressional Record, which declares that the item in the River and Harbor bill as passed au thorizes a 25 and 30-foot channel to the navy yard in the Elizabeth river when the bill was drawn for a 30 and 35-foot channel. The channel is already 28 feet deep and vessels of 30-foot draft have passed out. If the item in the Congres sional Record be not a misprint the bill must have been tampered with. Phila delphia interests are suspected here. Benjamin Lovitt, a negro boy, was arraigned in Berkley, charged itith the malicious wounding of John Allen, son of D. V. Allen. Allen and other white boys were playing marbles when the negro boys approached and a quarrel en sued. Allen was stabbed in the back with a pocketknife.

He wants to raise 40,000 by subscriptions if the City Coun cil of Lynchburg will appropriate 10,- 000 to make the amount 50,000. Dr. Smith offers to erect during this year a science hall, costing 20,000, and an addi tional dormitory, which will aid him in increasing the attendance by too young ladies, if the city will make the asked for appropriation.

Van landingham, sentenced to 12 months in jail for selling liquor in a local-option district, and Jack Lamb and Wade Gra ham, awaiting trial for house-breaking. The prisoners secured braces from their iron bedsteads and pried several bar from the bottom of the iron door. Crawling under the iron door, they used the bars as levers with which they pried open the outer wooden door leading into the hallway. They then pried the lock from the back door and escaped through the back yard. Apparently of its own accord a Southern railway passenger engine pulled out of the yards at Bristol and ran more than a mile down the Southerns main line, where it was found standing. Had it proceeded it would soon have collided with a freight train. All stations along the road were telegraphed to give warn ing of the runaway. Six unoccupied three-story houses at the corner of Virginia avenue and Twenty-eighth street, Newport News, were destroyed by fire. The buildings were owned by D. S. Jones and were valued, at ..about 5,000. When the Twenty-eighth street overhead bridge was erected its retaining wall was placed directly against the front porches of the tenements.

Both had resigned only recently from the Hudson Bay Com panys corps of voyaguers, and this was to be their first season as independent trappers. Except for a few roving Montagnnis Indians, the district was quite uninhabited, but inured to soli tude, the hardy young hunters were not men to lament the dearth of neigh bors. Their store of pelts accumulated steadily. Early in the winter Pierre brought in a silver fox skin, and later Camille secured a black one. But skins of the marten predominated. It was, in fact, what trappers terra a marten year. Like the migratory car ibou and their faithful followers, the wolf paeks, these highly prized little animals oeeasionaliy forsake their reg ular habitat. Years, during which few or none are to be found, may elapse before they renppear in numbers.  Tis a rare run of luck, Pierre, said Cnmllle, one evening in January  If it holds, we shall have a fine freight for Fort CUimo when the ice goes out of the river. In April a serious mishap befell. For some time game had been growing scarce. Day after day the young men returned empty-handed to the cabin The furs already procured surpassed in value their expectations, but their sup ply of provisions was nearly exhausted and they were dependent in large measure for food on the result of their hunting. Except grouse and ptar migan, bird and beast alike had appar ently fled from that vicinity. Camille set out one forenoon to make the rounds of their longest line of traps which extended northwest in the same direction as the river. He expected to be gone two days. The route which i was Pierres turn to follow, and which lay in the opposite direction, was or dinariiy covered in half that time. Snow was falling when Pierre nr rived at the end of his line. Pereeiv lng that a severe storm was at hand he hurried homeward at his best pace, Presently a blizzard was roaring through the woods, and the driving snow-spray soon obscured the trail compelling the trapper to seek shelte In a rocky den amid thick clumps of spruce. There he remained a prlsone for forty-eight hours, suffering intense ly with hunger, thirst and cold, befor an Intermission in the gale permitted him to proceed to the cabin. Camille was not there! Filled with anxiety, Pierre was pr paring to search for his comrade, when he was again storm-bound. It was not until five dnys had elapsed since Camilles departure that Pier! was enabled to start on his errand . relief. But bis quest proved futile, No trace of his missing partner could he find. Stormy weather prevailed almost con tinually throughout April, keepin Pierre indoors much of the time. Nev before in his twenty-four years had In activity proved so hard to bear. T! sorting and packing of furs furnish some occupation, but this done, the hours dragged heavily. But except for an occasional pain in ills forehead, no premonitory symptoms heralded the singular affliction that impended. One evening, shortly before the ice in the river broke up, Pierre was cut ting spruce for fuel near the door of his cabin. The sun had just dropped behind the bald lulls to southwestward, when, as he stood with ax uplifted, something seemed to pass swiftly be fore ids eyes, blotting out the waning daylight.  Bewildered, lie let ids ax fall, and drew ids band across his face, then blinked and pereed about. Darkness eneompased him. He was blind, ut terly blind. In fear and trembling, Pierre groped his way into the cabin and threw him self despairingly upon the bales of furs piled beside his bunk. Then, gradually taking heart, he tried to comfort himself with the hope that his misfortune would prove to be only temporary.  It is the night-blindness! he cried. It will pass away with the dawn. He recalled cases, one of which he had himself witnessed, where others had been afflicted with that peculiar loss of sight which the voyageurs of the north term night blindness. By day, the vision of those who suffer with the malady is seemingly unim paired, but when deprived of sunlight they immediately become absolutely powerless to see. Some maintain that the same conditions which produce that dread scourge of high latitudes, scurvy, are also responsible for this curious visual trouble but whether it is scor butic or not, its origin has yet to be satisfactorily explained. To poor Pierre, awaiting in deepest anxiety the dawn which was to reveal whether or not his sight was perma nently lost, that night seemed infinitely long. Supperless, he crept Into his bunk, where he tossed hour after hour, starting up nervously at every sound. Once he fancied he heard Camilles voice, but when he strained his ears to listen, there was only the whisper ing of the wind. A pair of smoke-colored Labrador jays, chattering hungrily as they flut tered about the cabin, roused him. g his eyes, he sprang from his y. His sight Opc bunk with a loud cry was restored!

Died at her home in Buckingham County in the 52nd, year of her age after a long and suffering illti-ss from the terrible affliction of cancer, Mrs. Jno. A. Burks duaghtcr of William Crews. , Mrs. Burks died a most triumphant death. Just as she was passing over the river she gave utterance to words that leave behind her the blissful assuranc that all was well with her soul. Her last words were open the door the Saviour has come. She was a consistent mem ber of Maple Grove Baptist church. She leaves behind her the husband, four daughters and five sons to mourn the loss of her. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord. Yea, they do rest from their labor, and verily, their works do follow them. We are sorry to report the contin ued and unimproved lllneSB of Mr, J. B, Gilliam. Tha Drs. however give strong hope ot Mr. Gilliams case.- The speciul microscopist who has examined into and reported on Mr. Gilliams case does not report discourugingly at all. The Road Board meets today under tte new order of things brought about by the special .act concerning the roads of Buckingham. The sole management of the roads of the county now is in the hands of the Board of Supervisors. Each member is supposed to look after the roads of his district. Anything in reason for good roads. Bucking ham needs them as badly as any county and it is a thing that any county can ill afford to do without. Would that our people could be thoroughly aroused on this extreme ly important matter. Mr. Eddie Glover left for his home near Andersonville on Saturday, feeling very much indisposed and as he did not return to his place of business with Mr. A. C. Garnett, Jr. on Monday morning it is feared that he is still ery much indisposed. There are no new developments in the now very important Forbes burning case. Old Mr. Forbes is still very ill with chances for recovery very much against, him. The sym pathy and the -incere admiration of the thinking public of the entire county is with Miss Janie Forbes, the brave, noble and selfsacrificing daughter, who underwent such a terrible ordeal on the night of the burning. After parsing through such a trial of soul and body she on that memorable morning gave utter ance to a suggestion to the old color ed woman who was her only compan ion, save her helpless father, that will live in the memory of the people of the county to the credit of Miss Janie when her body will sleep in the dust Aunt Nancy,the birds are singing let us sing too. Can there be evil in the heart that could give expression to such sentiment as these? nay verily. Misses Lillie and Nannie Gilliam are on a visit to the home of Mr. A. C. Garnett, Jr. We are glad to see Miss Nannie so much improved iu health. Rev. Mr. Sanford preached a very fine sermon on the text she hath done what she could, to a small congregation at the Maysvills Baptist Church last night. He evidently gave the members of his church something to think of. And tbe injunction he gave to his members were equally applicable to members of other churches, who were present. We love to here Bro. Sanford. Mry he preach to us long and often. 1 close this letter while the snow is falling. I hope it is the last one of a severely cold winter. Merited success to the T iues .
