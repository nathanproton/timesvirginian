Among senators who strong ly urged the unfairness of counting aliens in the ascer tainment of congress district populations was Senator Ty son, of Tennessee. He quoted at lengthj from Mr. Tuckers house address. In introduc ing these quotations, Senator Tyson said I would not Have had the temerity to present this mat ter to the senate but for the fact that I took up this matter with the Hon. St George Auck- er, of Virginia, a member of the house of representatives, who is considered one of the greatest constitutional lawyers of the country, a man who is looked upon in the house as perhaps the outstanding con stitutional lawyer in that body. After concluded the quota tions, Senator Tyson added Mr. President, I have read ex tracts from the address ofRep- resentative Tucker, who is, I know, one of the greatest con stitutional lawyers in the United States, and it is his con sidered opinion that the aliens in the United States should not be counted for the purpose of apportionment of represen tatives. Senator Sackett, of Kerf-  tucky, also made similar use of the Tucker speech and ex tolled the Virginian as one of the nations foremost author- ties on the constitution. Though it does not appear in the record, it is a fact that Senator Moses, Republican, of New Hampshire, approached .Mr. Tucker some time ago and asked him to give him the benefit of his opinion on the question.  This led Mr. Tuck er into an. examination of the constitution, and finally to the preparation of of the speech. It is probable that congress will not heed the Tucker argu ment.. But it is undoubtedly a fact that the address has en gendered doubt in many minds and the debate on the bill is appreciably lengthened in con sequence. Until this measure and the farm bill are out of the way, the administration lead ers ftll not dare to agree to a summer recess."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Sackett"], "snippet": "of represen tatives.
