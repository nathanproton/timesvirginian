On cross-examination witness ad mitted that Woolridge struck a trail which cirried him up to Dora Gulps after he came back from Appomat tox. We all went up there and measured an iron-sunk heel, about an 11 or 12 shoe l was satisfied there was nothing iu it. It is said you were charged with the burning? 1 have never been accused of this burning, except Cliff accused me of this buruiug, and I would like to in troduce witnesses to show that Cliff charged me with this burning. 1 would like to insist that the witness es b put on the stand to prove this fret. Some years ago there was bit terness between Woolridge and I. Superintendent J. K. Hannah, of Appomattox, said -he dined with E. C. Woolridge and his uaughter at ppomattox. He said Woolridge told him that all the buildings of J. S. Forbes were burned this was the first I had heard of the fire. J. F. Dickerson, an Appomattox School Trustee, testified that Wool ridge told him he wrote the will of the late Mr. Forbes, and when told that he Dickerson bad heard that Charlie Forbes was implicated, Woolridge replied that it v,as not so that Janie had written Charlie and he would be here in a few days. E. C. Spencer testifies  I heard that Charlie Forbes had been mur dered on the 21st March nothing had been done to,find him a party of Forbes, Morgan and myself went up to look for him Mr. B. T. Morgan said Charlie had come back I tried to find him and could not, went to Woolridges farm asked him out. Well, Cliff, wheres Charlie ? Who, Charlie Forbes? I dont know! He didnt have anything to do with the fire I wish I could find him. Ive got a letter I want to show you. He was go nervous he couldnt rend .t. He showed guilt as plain as an man he 3pencer ever saw. Well, Cliff, we have always been friends, and I have an Minpleasant duty to perform. Ill have to take you. All right. Ive been expecting it. Ill go with you. He asked lor time to pnt on his clothes we went iu with him he aBked I suppose you all have a warrant for me ? Cliff, you know me well enough tha I wouldnt come after you with out a warrant. Mrs. Woolridge said, JVhile the buildings were burning my littl boy was erving for Cliff to scratch his back that Charlie Forbes was there that morning he paid his father 9 for guano in the morning and came back that night and got it. We started out Wooldrige told only one of the children good bye told his wife to tell Hal Flood and Sam Ferguson to come on down. Where are you going to carry me ? We talked about Farmville an decided to go there Woolridge said he first heard of the fire the nex morning, and asked why didnt the foolish girl ring the bell. Why didnt you go over there and send your sou to Appomattox ?, 11 said he had a young horse to work denied that he had been writing to Charlie under an assumed name said his postofiice was Wert, a few days ago he had it changed to Forbes said that he had not received nidi from any other office. I have said that I would help lynch the parties who did the burn ing, out had no idea I would ever be caught. I am fifty-seven years old and this disgrace is tough. At Forbes postoffice we fe d. Did yopt say Charlie was withiu four and a-half miles of this place Woolridge answered, Echo an swers where?  Tell me and I will catch him ! This is not the time, he said I will tell Ira Orange where he can catch him At Wilburns bridge he called for paper and peucil and wrote Phone Winston McKiuney to see Joe Harvey at Rose Bower and find out positively about Charlie Forbes, and go on by Goins and Jones old place.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Last November the school electoral . board of this county elected six trustees. There were several changes made in the personnel of the board. This has given rise to dissatisfaction on the part of some of those who were not re-elected we understand, and of criticism by some adverse to the ac tion of the school board. This appears to us as being strange, as these positions have gener ally been regarded as burdensome and little sought after. But sup pose they are places of honor and emolumentdid not this same elec toral board elect these gentlemen when they were last elected P Then if the offices have not been burden some do these gentlemen not owe the board some measure of gratitude for the votes that elevated them to these honora ile posi ions ? Itisb u t right that these positions should change hands occasionally. A mail is elected for three years and not for life. When his three years is out, if he is not re-elected it does not imply bad treatment. In all of our educational institutions the vis itors and trustees are constantly be ing changed. O je of these gentlemen we under stand is getting up certificates of good character. His character has not been attacked or impugned as far as we have been able to learn, not a member of the board has said a word derogatory of one of the ex- trustees. We have to say that when public officers perform their official duties, the public will acqueise in the re sult, unless,tbei e is some very good reason for contrary action. There is certainly no good reason why D. M. Anderson, A. G. Owen, A. H. Howerton and W. P. Gills should not be put in any position of respon sibility. It may be interesting for the public to know that of the new trustees, Messrs. D. M. Anderson, Owen and Howerton were elected in i place of Messrs. E. L. Anderson, A. E. Walton and J. T. Moses without a dissenting vote on the board and all three members were present."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["J", "K", "Hannah"], "snippet": "T. A.

In 1870, this in novation met with considerable op position. Good judgment finally prevaield and the County Public School System was begun on a very modest scale. The first public school in this county was located in a log cabin near the Old Court House. The first teacher in the public school system was J. H. Featherston. The first County Superintendent of Schools was C. H. Chilton, 1870- 1881. He was succeeded by J. B. Bristow, who continued in office un til 1885. Mr. Chilton returned to office in that year and served until 1897. Sucessors in office were J. K. Hannah, 1897-1913 N. R. Feather ston, 1913-1926 and J. A. Burke, 1926 to date, The first public school house built with county funds was erected at Hurtsville. Other school structures were added as fast as funds from school taxes made these accomoda tions possible. Mr. N. R. Featherston, in his his tory of Appomattox County, re ports that the school term in the early days of the system was five months. Teachers average monthly salary was 25.00. In 1908, Professor Lindsay Craw ley was apointed principal of the high school at Appomattox. The frame building housing the high school stood on the lot where the present T. W. Moses residence is located. There were three teachers and 160. students. Funds allocated by the legislature in this year, with matching donations by private citi zens, financed the building of a new high school at the present site. Appomattox High School open ed in September, 1909, with the im posing name of Tenth Congression al District High School. Our public school system has made great advances in the years since 1909. In the past ten years alone, we have seen the construc tion of a new and up-to-date agri cultural vocational building at the high school addition of a hew gym nasium construction of the Carver- Price High School and elementary school for Negroes, and the build ing of the new elementary school in the town of Appomattox.

Judge Hundley opened his court here on Alonday afternoon. Alany chancery papers were put into his hands, and several orders entered. The first cases reached ou the law docket were those against C. H.

Three of these suits were tried on yesterday, namely, those brought by D. Alott Robertiou, J. H. Robertson, aud J. K. Hannah. In the first of these there was a verdict for 1000, anl in each of the other two for 800. Upon the calling of the first case, that of D. Mott Robertsou, ou Mon day afternoon, Mr. W. G. Franklin entered au appearauce as Counsel for Mr. Chilton, and after entering a plea of not guilty, moved for a change of venue, aud.iu support of his motion offered the affidavit of his client setting forth that there could not he a jury empanelled in Appomattox county that would do him justice that officials of the county were among the plaintiffs, aud their influence would override the cause of justice and that he could not come for fear of bodily harm. The court promptly over ruled the motion for a change of venue but granted the motion for a special jury. Ou Tuesday morning the Robert sou case was taken up, with the fol lowiug special jury J. F.

Mrs. Jenkins had been a great sufferer tor-many months and had several of the most skillful physicians to atteud her, but all in vain. Her work here was finished and the great Omnipotent took her home. Her life has been that of a Christian soldier, haviug entered the Lorus service in her early girlhood as a member of St. Pauls Episcopal church in this county, but later in life, under honest convictions she united with New Hope Baptist church, iu which she proved a faith ful, active worker, even after dis ease had fastened itself upon her. Mrs. Jenkins is survived by her aged paieuts, three brothers aud one sister, a devoted husband aud an only child, who with many other elatives and a host of friends mourn her death.  Blessed are the dead which die iu the Lord. Mrs. Jen kiiis was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J . J . Cheadle of this county. Truly the sympathetic hearts of our people go out to all the bereaved ouesa loving daugh ter, a foud sister and a faithful wife has been taken. In the pres ence of a large number of relatives and friends, the funeral services were conducted by her pastor Rev. P. T. Warren aud she was laid to rest in the family cemetery Satur day.
