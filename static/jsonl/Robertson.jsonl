The murals, each six feet long and four feet high, are fashioned from hundreds of tiny pieces of wood and present typical scenes o die life of Kentuckya steamboat, coal mine, sorghum mill and a to- baeco auction. No stains or paints are used  just the natural tints of some 50 dif ferent pieces of wood from five con tinents. One has only to vatch Fritz Bade their creator, at work, to realize that here is no stuntman, like the fellow who builds a model of th Eiffel tower from 11,000 toothpicks Although Bade has been an artist in oil, pencil, etching and wood al his life, he pursues art as an avoca tion. He has been a manufacture! and salesman for years. For several years, Merle Robert son, president of the Liberty Nation al Bank  Trust Co., has been giv ing an original Bade etching each Christmas to some of the bank larger depositors. After seeing some of the artists inlaid wood pictures Robertson decided a set of Bade murals would lend distinction to the banks proposed new building. There is color, depth, perspective and exp.rtssion in these glorified jic. saw puJzles. Blistered poplar has just tho right blotches of light and dark to make a buttermilk sky over the steamboat. Timber on the boat, stHiding out white against the cloudy siky and the muddy water. are cut from holly. The shadowy deck is Brazilian rosewood and a tiny awning on the afterdeck is tulip wood with lemon and orange colored stripes. Black and white striped zebra wood from Africa makes a sweater for one of the deckhands. Grain for anatomy, color for ef fect, is Bades rule. I never use a straight grained wood to depict a rounded surface of a body, he explains. The grain must conform to the shape to be portrayed.

Because of the duties of the office con nected with frequent terms of court since Mr. Proffitt entered upon the discharge of the duties of his office he has been unable to snake the change. Fredericksburg.Former State Sen ator R. C. L. Moncure, of -Stafford county, is being urged by his friends for the seat in the - State Industrial Comanislon, now held by Charles A. McHugh, of Roanoke. Mr. Moncure was the collector of internal revenue for this Federal district under the Wil son administration. The salary of a member of the State Industrial Com mission is 4,000 per year. Danville.Frank Robertson, of this city, indicted in the County Circuit Court on the charge of violating the Mapp act, was given his unconditional release when it was shown that, while officers had found a quantity of liquor in Robertsons house, they did not have a .search warrant. Judge A. M. Aiken ruled that evidence secured in this way could not be introduced against tne accused, whereupon the Commonwealths case collapsed. Norfolk.A proposal to establish a fair-price commission for the city mar ket and to clothe it w-ith full power to enforce its decisions, may be puti forward as a possible solution of one phase of Norfolks cost of living prob- lem as a result of the Inquiry now in progress. A recommendation Covering this point will probably be included in the report of the food committee which has been making a sweeping investiga tion into .prices on he market during the course of Its labors. Winchester.Mrs. Marguerite E. Harrison, -speaking under auspices of the Handley Foundation, graphically pictured her experiences while a pris oner of Soviets in Russia for many months. Her lecture was given in Market Street Methodist Episcopal Church, and She was introduced by R. Gray Williams, president of the hoard of Handley trustees. Mrs. Harrisons first appearance on the. lecture plat form was here, following her return from Germany some months after sign ing of the armistice. Lynchburg.W. C. Sale, clerk in charge of the postal car on Norfolk and Western Railway trains 15 and 16, Norfolk to Columbus, who lives in Nor folk, was painfully shot here When the regulation .45 caliber revolver the clerks are required to carry, slipped from his hand as he was attempting to put it in the holster. The steel jacket bullet struck Mr. Sale about eight inches below the left thigh and ranged in a zig-zag course around his hip. An X-ray negative, which was developed this forenoon, disclosed the fact that the bullet missed the thigh and hip hones and its location was re vealed, making its removal possible by a slight operation. Fredericksburg.  The historic Spottswood Inn, at Spotsylvania Court house, ten miles from this city, has been purchased by Mrs. Willie Rhoades Walter, of -that county, from Frederick W. Coleman, of this city. The property consisted of the hotel, outbuildings and ninety-four acres of land. Mrs. Waller has taken posses sion of the property and will remodel the Inn. This property is one of the historic landmarks of Spotsylvania county. It was used by General Robert E. Lee as headquarters daring the battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse and Bloddy Angle. Lynchburg.City Manager, Beck, in connection with the preparation for the city budget for 1922 here, has given the City Council a tentative -idea of what he has in mind to recommend for the .coming year, which would in clude along with general street im provements, the building of an athletic stadium at Thirteenth and Court streets on city owned property con version of the prfsent city market and city auditorium Into a city hall. This work, and the two new school buildings already authorized at a cost of 300,000."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Robertson"], "snippet": "4,000 per year.

T. Robertson, ss the most plausi ble solution, holds that the genealogy given in Matthew is that of Joseph, the legal father of Jesus, the genealogy in Luke that of Mary, with her husbands name substituted for hers. The earliest known attempt at reconciliation, made by Julius Africanus in the third century, A.D., holds that both are Josephs genealogies. He thought that Jacob and Heli were stepbrothers, and that under the rules of of Levirate marriage under which a man married his childless brothers widow and raise children for his brother Jacob married the widow of Heli and was the actual father of Joseph. Joseph could claim descent through both Jacob and Heli. A variant of this theory, proposed by Lord Arthur Hervey, thinks Matthews genealogy gives Josephs legal descent to show his valid claim to the throne of Israel. In this theory, the line of kings ended with Jeconiah and claim to the throne passed to another line of descent from David in Shealtiel. In the Roman world an adopted son shared as fully the heritage of his foster father as if he were actually of the blood. Thus Jesus, as Jospehs legal son, carried on Josephs heri tage. It was important to the Jews to show Jesus descent from David, for according to the prophecies the Messiah would be of Davids line, the successor to Davids throne. To claim Messiahship for Jesus required showing that His ancestry went back to David and that he could by right claim in the throne. Interpreting the Christ ev ent, as our topic terms the Incornation, involve more than identifying Jesus as the Mes siah. It must also show Him as Savior, carrying out the pur pose for which Messiah came. In His, the ultimate, revelation of God to men, Jesus Christ brings people into a new relationship with God Through His atonement, He makes it possible for men and women to become again members of the family and household of God, as they were created to be. For this purpose He had come into the world, not as a mighty prince distributing largess to his subjects, but as a child.

As noted this week in the news letter from Senator A. Willis Robertson, the Republican party is badly divided on matters of policy. More and more the President has to lean on Democratic support to get anything done. Senator Taft was one of the top Republicans who gave the President support, and he will therefore be missed. This news paper was often in disagreement with Senator Taft. His votes with the isolationists just prior to World War II were flirting with disaster. Senator Taft never seemed to grasp the basic concepts of foreign policy and fluttered from uncertainty to uncertainty. But it is to his credit that he fell in line with the policy of President Eisenhower, and did invaluable work in the role of the majority leader in the Senate.
