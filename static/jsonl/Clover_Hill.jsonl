Post Office at what is bow Appo mattox, Virginia. Information secured from Nation al Archives and the Post Office De partment, Washington, D. C., tells an interesting story of a full cen tury of mail service here. There have been 20 postmaster andor acting postmaster ap pointments in the 100 years of operation and the incumbent, E. LeRoy Smith, has served longer than any other. The name of the office has been changed several times. On February 23, 1855, a fourth class post office was established here and was call ed Nebraska, Virginia. The first postmaster was Samuel D. McDear- mon. Salary amounted to 6.01. The office operated under the name of Nebraska, Virginia until September 21, 1894, when it was changed to Appomattox. However, due to confusion with the Old Ap pomattox Court House community, the \u00f1am\u00e9 of the post office here changed on January 15, 189 to West Appomattox, Virginia. It oper ated under that name until June 27, 1906, when it took the present name of Appomattox, Virginia. The office became third class in 1909 and second class in 1987. In mid-1955 it is scheduled to become first class, due to volume of busi ness. Several years ago it became first class, but reverted to second class due to a shift in parcel post business.

It is shown that the name oi the county was changed to Prince Edward on March 22, 1837, that the name of the office was changed to Clover Hill on July 7, 1837 and that the county in which the office was lo cated was changed to Appomattox sometime between September 23, 1845 and June 30, 1849. The re cords show that the name of the office was changed to Appomattox Court House on February 3, 1859 and changed to Appomattox on July 3, 1892.  It therefore appears that the his tory of a post office at what is now without a post office but known as Old Appomattox Court House, is equally interesting. That part of the county was in Buckingham when the post office was established as Floods in 1811. Later it became a part of Prince Edward and finally Appo mattox in 1845. Shortly after the burning of the court house in 1892, the court house was rebuilt at what is now the Town of Appomattox, and final ly the post office at the historic old village was discontinued. It was of ficially Appomattox Court House, Virginia, at the time Gen. Lee sur rendered to Gen. Grant.

They find that the original Court house of Appomattox County, built in 1846, stood in the traffic circle directly in front of Clover Hill Tavern. It no longer exists in that it was burned in 1892. Since the Village no longer had the prestige of being the principal stop on the Stage Line, the new court house building was erected in nearby Appomattox on the railroad. However, this wasnt what they really wanted to know they wanted to know where the surrender occured. They are told that it happened in the McLean House 100 yards to the west of the circle. They are informed that when the books say that the surrender occurred at Appo mattox Court House they are speaking of the entire village rather than tlye building Itself. They are told that it is a. custom peculiar to Virginia that the county seats originally bore the name of the county and the term Court House. Surrender Locale The surrender itself was divided into several phases. First, Lee and Grant met, discussed and signed the terms of sur render in the McLean House, and then th\u00e9 three commissioners appointed from each army met in the Tavern and McLean House. The physical surrender of arms occurred three days later on April 12 , 1865, along the road to the east of the traffic circle and, finally, the paroles were printed and issued from the Tavern. With this general briefing they how enter IMS Tavern. Here they see a number of displays concerning the retreat to Ap pomattox, the final fighting, the surren der, and a little concerning the Village itself.

They never dreamed that the Tavern they built at Clover Hill, in 1819, would become the museum of relics of a great peace for a nation re united after four years of bitter internacine war. Clover Hill Tavern is the oldest building at the Appomattox Court House National Military Park. It has just been restored and houses the National Park Service Museum . . . a museum now displaying as a late addition the famous Guillaume paint ing of the Surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee to Gen. U. S. Grant, April 7, 1865. Another new feature is an electric map, showing just where the great events of history occured here. Two brothers, Alexander and Lil bourne Patteson, opened a stage coach line from Lynchburg to Rich mond in 1811. At that time the im mediate area at what is now Old Appomattox Court House was a part of Prince Edward County, Appomat tox County not having been estab lished until 1845. In 1814 the Pat teson brothers purchased 206 acres laying near the north branch of the Appomattox River from one John B. Sadler. The land was valued at 157.89. In 1819 they built the Clover Hill Tavern, and the property zoomed to a value of 7,890. There is quite a story about these Patteson -brothers. A 208 page In formal History of the Virginia-Ken- tucky Pattesong in Illinois, Their Forbears and Their Kin by Ethel Marion Smith, traces the Patteson ancestry back to 1680. The first Pat teson entry in St. Peters Parish Reg ister in Eastern Virginia, shows that one Thomas Patteson came over from England in 1680 and settled on what is known as Roxbury Plan tation. Thomas Patteson had five sons Thomas, Edward, David, Alex ander and Geofrge, The next name to look for was Obfcdiah Patteson, who the St. Peters Parish Register says was born in 1750. His second son was named Littleberry . . . and father and son, Obediah and Little- berry took up land patents in this section in 1782. Records exist that show! that Obediah Patteson paid taxes on 800 acres of land in Camp bell County from 1782 through 1791. Littleberry Patteson was born in New Kent County in February, 1754, married in 1782 and died June 23, 1827. He fought in the Revo lutionary War. He is known to have paid taxes on land in Buckingham County from 1793 to 1814. He married Matilda Smith. Lilbourne and Alexander, build ers of Clover Hill Tavern, were sons of Littleberry Patteson. They owned Clover Hill Plantation, under a deed dated November 25, 1814. Alexander Patteson died in 1836, and his fam ily moved to Kentucky. Family rec ords show that the family was prom- ient. David Patteson of Chesterfield, Jonathan of Lunenburg, and Charles of Buckingham represented their re spective counties in the Virginia Convention of 1788 to ratify the United States Constitution. A stage coach line was a great thing 150 years ago. Clover Hill Tavern was a grand conception at a time when Americans were fan ning out from the Atlantic Coast and moving Westward. The Clover Hill Tavern remained in the hands of the Patteson family until Aug ust 8, 1839, when it passed to John Raine. It was transferred to Hugh Raine in 1842 for the sum of 3,- 200, and again passed to Samuel McDearmon in 1845. McDearmon, a great leader in the early growth of this section and one of the top citizens of his time, added many outbuildings and improvements to the Tavern. However, he sold the property to Samuel Glover in 1854. The foundation lines of this store are today readily apparent as a de pression in the ground between the Tavern and the Ferguson home, re cently used as Park Service office. About the year 1859, Glover transferred his holdings to Wilson Hix. The holdings at that time con sisted of lots 16 and 17 in the vil lage of Appomattox Court House and contained the Tavern and its outbuildings. Hix operated the prop erty as a hotel all through the Civil War period. It was yvritten up in the New York Hearld in April, 1865. It was referred to as Glenns Hotel and was used as the office of the paroling officer. Gen. Sharpe. In 1880, it was transferred from the estate of Wilson Hix to Edward G. Hix and included lots 11, 17, 18 and part of lot 16 in the village. The ownership continued to change hands until finally resting in the Continued on Page Eight"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Clover", "Hill"], "snippet": "Tavern they built at <mark>Clover</mark> <mark>Hill</mark>, in 1819, would become"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Clover", "Hill"], "snippet": "Tavern they built at <mark>Clover</mark> <mark>Hill</mark>, in 1819, would become"}], "text_match": 1157451471441100921, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2211897868288", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1157451471441100921", "tokens_matched": 2, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
