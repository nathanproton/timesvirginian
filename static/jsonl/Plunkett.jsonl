Post Office at what is bow Appo mattox, Virginia. Information secured from Nation al Archives and the Post Office De partment, Washington, D. C., tells an interesting story of a full cen tury of mail service here. There have been 20 postmaster andor acting postmaster ap pointments in the 100 years of operation and the incumbent, E. LeRoy Smith, has served longer than any other. The name of the office has been changed several times. On February 23, 1855, a fourth class post office was established here and was call ed Nebraska, Virginia. The first postmaster was Samuel D. McDear- mon. Salary amounted to 6.01. The office operated under the name of Nebraska, Virginia until September 21, 1894, when it was changed to Appomattox. However, due to confusion with the Old Ap pomattox Court House community, the \u00f1am\u00e9 of the post office here changed on January 15, 189 to West Appomattox, Virginia. It oper ated under that name until June 27, 1906, when it took the present name of Appomattox, Virginia. The office became third class in 1909 and second class in 1987. In mid-1955 it is scheduled to become first class, due to volume of busi ness. Several years ago it became first class, but reverted to second class due to a shift in parcel post business. The following is a list of post masters and their terms Samuel D. MeDearmon, February 23, 1855 Richard H, Mavin, December 31. 1855 Robert I, Boaz, October 4, 1866 Thomas E. Walton, December 22 1867k D- Hix, April 20, 1869 Willbfo l CoIKntf April 1 , i860 Mrs. Mary J. Atwood, February 10, 1666.  Ada A. Landrum, June 26, 1866 N. H. Gregory, October 30, 1867 Miss Elizftb\u00e9th H. Dee, J\u00e1niury 21, 188 Rufus Furdum, January 1, 1873 Samuel H. Coleman, July 26, 1889 John S. Plunkett, May 9, 1898 Robert Irby, May 7, 1897 Leslie F. Ferguson, May 20, 1918 Robert Irby, April 28, 1922 Lula G. Irby, Acting Postmaster. Ap ril 21, 921 Alfred R. Harwood, Acting Poet- master, May 15, 7931 Joseph E. Dinwiddle, June 1, 1982 E. LeRoy Smith, Acting Poet- master, June 1, 1034 Regular Appointment, March 8, 1936. However, this was not the first pqst. office in what is now Appomat tox County, Tie following inform ation  supplied by the National Archives and reports of the Post Office Department Appomattox County, Virginia The records show that this office was established on April 1, 1811, under the name of Floods, Buckings ham County, Virginia, with Thomas Trent the first postmaster. It is shown that the name oi the county was changed to Prince Edward on March 22, 1837, that the name of the office was changed to Clover Hill on July 7, 1837 and that the county in which the office was lo cated was changed to Appomattox sometime between September 23, 1845 and June 30, 1849. The re cords show that the name of the office was changed to Appomattox Court House on February 3, 1859 and changed to Appomattox on July 3, 1892.  It therefore appears that the his tory of a post office at what is now without a post office but known as Old Appomattox Court House, is equally interesting. That part of the county was in Buckingham when the post office was established as Floods in 1811. Later it became a part of Prince Edward and finally Appo mattox in 1845. Shortly after the burning of the court house in 1892, the court house was rebuilt at what is now the Town of Appomattox, and final ly the post office at the historic old village was discontinued. It was of ficially Appomattox Court House, Virginia, at the time Gen. Lee sur rendered to Gen. Grant. Undocumented stories often told here relate that in the gold rush days a hundred years and more ago?- some family started out for Ne braska, got this far and liked the place so much that they decided to settle here and call this Nebraska.

Mrs. S. S. Shouse, an expert at staging flower shows, since he is an accredited flower show judge, is serving as program chairman for the show, which will be built around the Old Country Store theme. She presented a unique way of print ing the program. Mrs. W. W. Burke, and Mrs. R. C. Hubbard, co-chairman of the schedule committee, brought in a listing of items which would be of interest and typical of a Country Store. They suggested that mem bers beg or borrow such items as an Old Tobacco Plug Cutter, Old Ladies Bonnets, Home Made Lye Soap, High Top Lace Shoes, A Wooden Churn, Lamp Chimneys, etc. They would .be _used in creating the Country Store Atmosphere in staging the show. Doesnt sound much like flow ers does it? Well, just you wait and see what these ladies will do with themand the flowers. Mrs. Harwood has chosen her chairmen wisely and well in order to make this the biggest and most beautiful flower show Appomattox has ever hada show to do justice to the countys rich heritage. And it is bound  to be just that. The flo-wer show will be staged at the Old Plunkett-Meeks House at Old Appomattox Court House on April 24 and 25. Arrangements will be in keeping with the period around 1865. So whether you know it or not, all of Appomattox is going to be turned upside down in the next two months by Garden Club members rummag ing for heirlooms and other pieces of historic interest to be used in some of the rooms and in arrange ments. The ladies finally adjourned and the next visit will be to the Plunkett- Meeks House, where they will decide on placements of various types of exhibits. Here the other committees will take over, a complete listing of which will appear in a couple of weeks.
