Mr. A H Howerton says the un tied ballots were burnt by Mr. 8. P.

Oh, Troth, Truth, bow much thy very existence depends on bolts sod bars, on windows and doors, on hoars and minutes,on the best qual ity of window shades or on an old iilapidated boose. Mr. A. H. Howerton goes to the trouble to prove what he was not charged with, I suppose for the pur pose of drawing the attention of the eader from the facta in tbe esse. It is said that a worm partakes of the color of the food on which it feedt the same law of nature mast pply to Mr. A. H Howerton, who has fed ao long at the adder uf boiiism that he is doomed to think and set in accordance with tbe only light which has been given himan artificial lightwhich has so col ored his view that he no longer can distinguish right from wrong or good from evil. His or ginality and is taste has been destroyed. He rejoices in boteism, in which he has been told that might makes right. Now as for his saying I was en gaged in tbe drcnlation of a false hood and under other conditions vss simply lying, I have simply his to sa that where Mr. A H Howerton is known especially i. he tobacco belt nothing that be can say will hart me, and where I m known nothing that he may say rill harm ms. Bostum has altered tbe common highwaymans demand of your money or yonr life into that of your money and yonr life.
