The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

First, we had a feast of humor land flow of soul in a two-hours speech by Col. James Marshall, of Craig. The speaker was gracefully introduced by Col. It. T. Huba.d, who said he had rtood shoulder to shoulder with him in the Legislature in trying to save to the State th old Kanawah canal, and speaking of Col. Marshall as a big hearted man. Col Marshall opened by addressing himself to soldieis of every flag, col ored men of every hue. He then told of deeds of valor done by the Confi derate soldiers, bow at Antie- tum 35,000 Confederates, who were in a half starved condition, drove back 90,000 Federal soldiers.

I want it writ ten of me that I made more people laugh than cry. I have seen a Con federate soldier presiding over the Senate of the United States. I have seen one a judge of the Supreme Court. They have gotten all the good offices they could get. Some way, somehow, in the gret beyond, I think there will be a Confederate reunion. He spoke of how few of the old commanders were now liv ing, and mentioned M. B.
