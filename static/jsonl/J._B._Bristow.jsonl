The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

In 1870, this in novation met with considerable op position. Good judgment finally prevaield and the County Public School System was begun on a very modest scale. The first public school in this county was located in a log cabin near the Old Court House. The first teacher in the public school system was J. H. Featherston. The first County Superintendent of Schools was C. H. Chilton, 1870- 1881. He was succeeded by J. B. Bristow, who continued in office un til 1885. Mr. Chilton returned to office in that year and served until 1897. Sucessors in office were J. K. Hannah, 1897-1913 N. R. Feather ston, 1913-1926 and J. A. Burke, 1926 to date, The first public school house built with county funds was erected at Hurtsville. Other school structures were added as fast as funds from school taxes made these accomoda tions possible. Mr. N. R. Featherston, in his his tory of Appomattox County, re ports that the school term in the early days of the system was five months. Teachers average monthly salary was 25.00. In 1908, Professor Lindsay Craw ley was apointed principal of the high school at Appomattox. The frame building housing the high school stood on the lot where the present T. W. Moses residence is located. There were three teachers and 160. students. Funds allocated by the legislature in this year, with matching donations by private citi zens, financed the building of a new high school at the present site. Appomattox High School open ed in September, 1909, with the im posing name of Tenth Congression al District High School. Our public school system has made great advances in the years since 1909. In the past ten years alone, we have seen the construc tion of a new and up-to-date agri cultural vocational building at the high school addition of a hew gym nasium construction of the Carver- Price High School and elementary school for Negroes, and the build ing of the new elementary school in the town of Appomattox.

On April 17th, 1902, Beavers made the following memorandum upon the papers in relation to this office Hon. C. A. Swanson, M. C.

Again we find this endoisement Swanson endorse in favor ot Schmelz. Accept Schmelz. G. .V. B. Schmelz Brothers were the men whose property was alreauy leased for three hundrtd and sixty dollars per annum, and whose rental had been unjustifiably increased to four hundred and eighty dollars per an num while the government still h-d a valid lease on the premises good until September 1st, 1902. The proposition of Schmelz to rent the property to the government at seven hundred and twenty dollars per an num from September 1st, 1902, was accepted, notwithstanding the in spectors report showing that the proposed building at six hundred dollars per annum was deemed more desirable, and contained heat, light and equipment for an up-to date postoffice. After the report of Bristow,show ing the conduct of members of con gress in thur dealings with the offi cials of th postoffice department, a select committee was appointed by the House of Representatives to look into the matter. This committee made what is known as the McCall Whitewash Report, which was the butt of ridicule for tbe newspaper- of the country, and though this re port did everything to apologize for the conduct of members of cougrest it said that letters such as were written by Beavers to Swanson a 1 vising him what was done as a fa vor to the member might well have been resented. Shortly after the postoffice scan dal became known to the public the President appointed Hon. Holmes Conrad, ex-solicitor general and a distinguished Virginian, as an as sistant to the attorney general in the investigation. Associated with Holmes Conrad was Charles Bonaparte, now secre tary of the  avy, and a distinguish ed Maryland lawyer. In their report, which may b found on page 201 of House Docu ment No. 383, they state in refer dug to members ol congress who have received favors from Beaver , and who knew of Beavers acts, nc folio we He the congressman stood in a fiduciary relation to the government, and so far from being justified in taking advantage of any breach f trust on the part of the official with wtom he dealt, was bound, in oi r opinion, to expose this breach i f trust, both to the latters superio ind to the House of Representative Signed H o l m e s C on h a d , Signed C h a s . J. B o n a p a r t e Special Assistants to the Attorney General. On March 11th, 1904, the House of Representatives had under con sideration a resolution for ,he ap pointment of a committee to inves tigate the charges against memb rs of congress in relation to postoffic frauds perpetrated by Beavers. Postmaster General Bristow had reported nine hundred fraudulent allowances by Beavers, affecting members and senators. Representa ttve Robinson, a Democratic con gressman from Arkansaw, declared that t.he postoffice department had given to he government the great est scandal known to modern times, a scandal that is a stench in the nos trils of every law-abiding, self-re specting citizen, a scandal which shows conclusively that officers employed in that department had robbed and stolen and plundered from the government for years and years, and that every effoit to inves tigate their conduct save only by and through officers and employes of the department had been defeat ed, The Congressional Record for that day shows that a great number of members of the house rose to a question of personal privilege and attempted to explain their relations with Beavers and to exonerate them selves from the serious charges of the Bristow report. A motion was made by Mr. Overstreet, a Republi can member from Indiana, for unanimous consent that ten days general leave to print be given to members. John Sharp Williams, of Mississippi, the Democratic leader on the floor of the house, objected, and said I thiuk it would be well that whatever is to be said to the country about so delicate a subject as this should be said in open house. Applause. The friends of those congressmen who had been involved in Beavers frauds repeatedly renewed their mo tion for leave to print and each time the motion was defeated by tbe ob jection of Mr. Williams, the Demo cratic leader.

LeGrand having taken the greatest number of rings was awarded the crown. Messrs. Hunter Abbitt, Jonee, and Browning having each secured 7 rings, they rode for firet honor, and Browning lead iu the tie with 7 and Abbitt second with 6 rings. The first honor was awarded to Daniel Browning. At this point the judges allowed all Knights who had not secured honors to enter the tournament lor second and third honors with three rides each, which resulted in a tie between H. W. McKinney and Jas. Payne, each taking 7 rings. Mc- Kinuey and Payne decided which should have second honor by a sing le tilt, McKiuuey taking all three rings, and Payne took two, and was awarded the second honor aud the third was awarded to Payne. All agreed that there was too much riding, but under the rule it could uot be avoided. The boys are under obligations to Capt. Jno. R. Martin, of Faunville, for the use of his clamps, which held the ringsand uot a few of the boys claim the clamps held them so good the hole in the ring was hard to locate. In justice to many of the riders it is proper to say that their regular lauceswere tuled out, and they had to ride with uevr lances, without practice. Col. R. B. Berkeley took charge of those who bore off the much cf- eted honors when night came, aud whim Miss Ruby Harvey, of Dan ville, Va., gathered aiouuu her in the ball room at Atwouiis Hotel her maids of honor, the scene was one of grace mid beauu. Col. Berke leys address uus highly appropriate aud w-ll-received by tlie large audi ence pretence. A temporal stage was erected and upon ii. sat ibe Queen of Love and Beauty, .dies Harvey, surrounded by her maids and the gallant Knights who held honors iu their hand to bedeck the brow of his queen L. B. LeGrand crowned Mias Roby Harvey Queen of Love aud Beauty. Daniel Browning crowned Miss Bertha Caldwell First Maid of Honor. H. W. McKinney crowned Miss Lucy Smith, Second Haid ot Honor. Jas. Payne crowned Miss Mattie Berkeley, of Lynchburg, Third Maid of Houor. The royal set wao then danced, after which the dancing became general and lasted uulil 6 a. lit. The supper by Hostess Abbitt was iudeeu a special feature of the occasion, and but for lack of space we would give the bill of fare. Suffice to say it was served in royal style and was highly enjoyed. The young men maintained the reputatiou of the village for its known hospitality and this occasion sheds new lustre around the chiv alry of tpe good people of our com munity."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["J", "B"], "snippet": "Geo.

A fter m any i years of delay, the bill looking to 1 the creation of national forest re- 1 serves in the W hite M ountains and the Southern Appalachians, passed I the Senate, the vote standing 57 to 9. The negative vote was cast by Senators Bristow, Burton, Clark, of W yom ing Cullom, Grouna and Mc- Cum ber, Republicans, and Senators Davis, P aynter and Shively, Demo crats. The bill passed the house of R epresentatives last session, and as it was accepted by the Senate w ith out change, it lacks only the signa tu re of the President to elevate it into a statute. The entire day was given to the subject by the Senate. Senators Brandegee, of Connecticut, and Gal- linger, of New Ham pshire, stood as the special sponsors of the m easure. Mr. Brandegee made a brief speech in the interest of an early vote. Sen ators Simmons, of North Carolina, and Newlands, of Nevada, spoke in support of the bill, and Senators B ur ton, of Ohio, and Heyburn, of Idaho, in opposition. The supporters of the m easure resisted all efforts at am end m ent on the theory th at any change would im peril the bill in the House. W hile it is understood on all sides th at the purpose of the bill is the acquisition of lands In the W hite M ountains of New England and of the Appalachians, in the Southern States, for the creation of forest re serves, it contains no specific m en tion of such purpose. The author ity for this proceeding is found in the general powers conferred by the bill. The carrying into effect of the pro visions of th\u00e8 bill is placed in the i hands of a commission, to he com- I posed of the Secretary of W ar, the j Secretary Of the Interior, the Secre tary of A griculture, two senators and two m em bers of the House of Rep- ! resentatives. The purchase of land is placed in the hands of the Secretary of Agri culture and is confined to such areas as may affect the head w aters of navigable stream s. No purchase is to be authorized until passed upon by the Geological Survey. The land once acquired, it is to be cut up into forest, reserves, as may seem best for adm inistrative purposes.
