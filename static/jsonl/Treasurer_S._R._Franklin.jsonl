The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Col. Robert A. Marr, professor of en gineering at the Virginia Military Insti tute, at Lexington, has resigned to go to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, at Blacksburg. It was ascertained in Lynchburg on good authority that the impending re- port of the Southern Railways business for the fiscal year ended June 30 will be one of the most remarkable annual re ports ever made by a railroad in the South. The year has been the best the system has ever enjoyed, and the in crease in revenues is said to make a wonderful showing. The report is tc be issued in the next few days. The corner-stone o the elaborate monument to be erected in Richmond to Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, will be laid November 8 with simple ceremonies. It is proposed to unveil the monument June 3, 1907, the ninety-ninth anniversary of the birth of Mr. Davis. The contract for the purchase of the real estate necessary as a site for the memorial was closed. The memorial will be located at the intersec tion of Cedar and Franklin streets, and is to be surrounded hy a circle with a radius sufficient to afford an environ ment in keeping with the massive and handsome design. The monument is to consist of a semi circular structure of columns connected and surmounted by a massive cornice and with a towering column within the arp. This great column is to be sur mounted by a figure of Liberty, while beside the column on an appropriate ped estal will stand a statue of the Confed erate President. There were for a long time differences of view as to the proper site for the mon ument. Monroe Park having been fitst selected. Later there was a movement to locate it at the corner of Twelfth and Broad streets and make it in the form of a greht arch, spanning Broad street, near the site of the White House of the Confederacy. Owing to the ob jection of Mrs, Davis to the Broad street site this plan was abandoned. Mrs. Davis also disapproved the design of the arch and later the semi-circular de sign was chosen. It is proposed to in vite the United Confederate Veterans to hold their reunion in Richmond in 1907 and to take part in the unveiling cere monies. This invitation will be extend ed at the meeting next year. Mr. George F. Rathvon, a dry goods merchant of Danville, has filed a deed of assignment. Mr. E. T. Lewis is named as trustee.

There was a fierce struggle, during which Mrs. Jones cries attracted her husbands at tention.

The lower court, however, was reversed by the Circuit Court of A p peals, and when the case was taken up in the United States District Court,M r. Birds counsel stated that he did not de sire to prosecute the case further, as he was unable to give the security. Judge Paul accordingly dismissed the suit, or dering that the plaintiff pay defend ants costs. Floyd Eaton, the young-son of Mr. William Eaton, of Capon Bridge, was shot, and perhaps fatally, by Lap John son. The latter was riding along the road, and he saw some object running along beneath some trees a considerable distance, ahead of him. He thought the object was a dog and fired with a dou ble-barreled shotgun. The object prov ed to be young Eaton, and the entire load struck him in the back. The wounded lad was carried by Johnson to his fathers home and a physician sum moned. His injuries are serious and perhaps fatal. Johnson was not arrest ed, as the affair was clearly an accident.

It is called to hear the boom cases of the Berryville Land and Improvement Co. against delinquent stockholders, who are resisting payment of assessment on the stock of that company, which went into the hands of a receiver some years back. There are no cases now pending on the docket of this court in which so much feeling has been engendered and which are as hotly contested as these cases.
