They never dreamed that the Tavern they built at Clover Hill, in 1819, would become the museum of relics of a great peace for a nation re united after four years of bitter internacine war. Clover Hill Tavern is the oldest building at the Appomattox Court House National Military Park. It has just been restored and houses the National Park Service Museum . . . a museum now displaying as a late addition the famous Guillaume paint ing of the Surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee to Gen. U. S. Grant, April 7, 1865. Another new feature is an electric map, showing just where the great events of history occured here. Two brothers, Alexander and Lil bourne Patteson, opened a stage coach line from Lynchburg to Rich mond in 1811. At that time the im mediate area at what is now Old Appomattox Court House was a part of Prince Edward County, Appomat tox County not having been estab lished until 1845. In 1814 the Pat teson brothers purchased 206 acres laying near the north branch of the Appomattox River from one John B. Sadler. The land was valued at 157.89. In 1819 they built the Clover Hill Tavern, and the property zoomed to a value of 7,890. There is quite a story about these Patteson -brothers. A 208 page In formal History of the Virginia-Ken- tucky Pattesong in Illinois, Their Forbears and Their Kin by Ethel Marion Smith, traces the Patteson ancestry back to 1680. The first Pat teson entry in St. Peters Parish Reg ister in Eastern Virginia, shows that one Thomas Patteson came over from England in 1680 and settled on what is known as Roxbury Plan tation. Thomas Patteson had five sons Thomas, Edward, David, Alex ander and Geofrge, The next name to look for was Obfcdiah Patteson, who the St. Peters Parish Register says was born in 1750. His second son was named Littleberry . . . and father and son, Obediah and Little- berry took up land patents in this section in 1782. Records exist that show! that Obediah Patteson paid taxes on 800 acres of land in Camp bell County from 1782 through 1791. Littleberry Patteson was born in New Kent County in February, 1754, married in 1782 and died June 23, 1827. He fought in the Revo lutionary War. He is known to have paid taxes on land in Buckingham County from 1793 to 1814. He married Matilda Smith. Lilbourne and Alexander, build ers of Clover Hill Tavern, were sons of Littleberry Patteson. They owned Clover Hill Plantation, under a deed dated November 25, 1814. Alexander Patteson died in 1836, and his fam ily moved to Kentucky. Family rec ords show that the family was prom- ient. David Patteson of Chesterfield, Jonathan of Lunenburg, and Charles of Buckingham represented their re spective counties in the Virginia Convention of 1788 to ratify the United States Constitution. A stage coach line was a great thing 150 years ago. Clover Hill Tavern was a grand conception at a time when Americans were fan ning out from the Atlantic Coast and moving Westward. The Clover Hill Tavern remained in the hands of the Patteson family until Aug ust 8, 1839, when it passed to John Raine. It was transferred to Hugh Raine in 1842 for the sum of 3,- 200, and again passed to Samuel McDearmon in 1845. McDearmon, a great leader in the early growth of this section and one of the top citizens of his time, added many outbuildings and improvements to the Tavern. However, he sold the property to Samuel Glover in 1854. The foundation lines of this store are today readily apparent as a de pression in the ground between the Tavern and the Ferguson home, re cently used as Park Service office. About the year 1859, Glover transferred his holdings to Wilson Hix. The holdings at that time con sisted of lots 16 and 17 in the vil lage of Appomattox Court House and contained the Tavern and its outbuildings. Hix operated the prop erty as a hotel all through the Civil War period. It was yvritten up in the New York Hearld in April, 1865. It was referred to as Glenns Hotel and was used as the office of the paroling officer. Gen. Sharpe. In 1880, it was transferred from the estate of Wilson Hix to Edward G. Hix and included lots 11, 17, 18 and part of lot 16 in the village. The ownership continued to change hands until finally resting in the Continued on Page Eight"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["McDearmon", "McDearmon"], "snippet": "again passed to Samuel <mark>McDearmon</mark> in 1845. <mark>McDearmon</mark>, a"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["McDearmon", "McDearmon"], "snippet": "again passed to Samuel <mark>McDearmon</mark> in 1845. <mark>McDearmon</mark>, a"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

While no doubt man j have de cided views a to whom they will vote for, but little or no pub lic demonstrations have taken place throughout the county and while a few public gatherings have been held, the attendance at these meetings have been small and little interest in such meetings have been manifested.

Colonel Terrell being a candidate for what is called the organizations forces and Mr, Gannaway representing t h e antis. In this, like other county contests, there has been no issue and the fight hangs chiefly on personalities. In some quarters, the question of the short ballot issue has been in jected in which Mr. Gannaway ias declared himself as opposed to the short ballot, while no such statement has come from Mr. Terrell other than he is for the administration policies. As the short ballot, is an administra tion policy, however, it is regard ed that Mr. Terrell is for it, and su far, that is about the main is sue involved between the two candidates for that office.

At Pamplins we spent several hours most delightfully with thej family of Rev. W. E. Warren and Dr. and Mr. C. S. Morton, friends of other days. The drive from Pamplins over beyond Putneys was very pleasant, but we missed the mail boxes along the way. Crops  of all kir.ds are good, especially to bacco and fruit abundant. One lady said there had been over a hundred bushels of peaches gat bar -1 ed from her orchard, and every -1 w h ere such quantities of beautifull flowers we never saw.

It is indeed a beuuti-l ful building and reflects great cred -1 it on the architect, Mr. Frank Allen of Tredway. He is an elder in the church and did roost of the work himself. This good old county is I the very plant bed of Presbyteri an, and of all the host of people we met, we shook hands with only four Baptsts and one Methodist. It was a saddened joy to sit in that vast congregation and look aiound in search of familiar faces,II and there were very few whom we recognisedthe boys and girls with whom we bad had such goodtimesl twenty-eight years ago are staid I men and women now with grown I children, and in some cases grand children, around them, and the hair that was once brown or black I is now streaked with grey.

It was a blessed privilege to meet I with Mrs. Letitia McDearmon, Allen I the last of the old McDearmon I family of Appomattox.

She is in her 83d year, I and is quite feeble, and as we held! her trembling hand at parting we I thought it would not be long be -1 fore she would hear the Well done I of her Master, whom she has sol faithfully served and enter into her reward. At Felden, near Hampden Sidney we enjoyed meeting with Sargeant Rchard Allen, who served all through the Mexican and Civil wars It was indeed a treat to listen to his reminiscences. He is in his 83d year and is still very fond of hunt ing. We heard much in praise of Dr. McAllister, the new president of Hampden Sidney, and it is thought the number of students at the col lege will largely exceed that of last year. At Prospect we met with an old Appomattox friend, Mrs. Wm. Lew is. How our tongues did fly as we talked of the past, present and fu ture, and all too soon we heard the train that was to take us home. There are other things we would like to write about, but to tell of all the pleasure that was crowded into those ten days would make this letter too long.
