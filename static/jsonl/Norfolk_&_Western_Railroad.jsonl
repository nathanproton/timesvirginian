On the 8th day of June, 1893, the Norfolk  Western Railroad Com pany was indicted by an Appomattox Grand Jury tor running freight trains on Sunday. The case came up for trial and was tried at the November term folloing of the county court. They were found guilty and a fine of 50 was imposed. The company appealed the case to the Circuit Court, which at the De cember term 1893, affirmed the decision of our county court. The case was carried io the  Supreme Court of Appeals, where it has been pending ever since. The Court of Appeals, in its opinion rendered last Thursday, says Norfolk and Western Railroad Company vs. the Commonwealth. Section 3801 of the Code, which prohibits railroad companies from running freight, trains on Sunday, is held not to be in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, and is a valid exercise of the police power of the State for the protections of the morals and health of the people. The State has the right in order to secure and protect the laws or health of its citizens, or to preserve good order, and the public morals, to legislate for such purposes. And where it is done in good faith, and without discrimination against in terstate or foreign commerce, it is not in violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, although such legis lation may sometimes touch in its exercise the line separating the re spective domains of Federal and State authority, aud, to some extent, affect interstate and foreign com merce. Immediately after the opinior was handed down by the Supremt Court the Norfolk and Westeri. Railroad issued oreders that nt freight trains should he run on Sundays. This case was argued in the County and Circuit Courts by Hon .H. D.  Flood for the commonwealth and stubbornly fought by Judge W. H. Mann and F. S. Kirkpatrick, Esq., for the Railroad Company. Our able Commonwealths At torney has taken a great deal of interest in this case, and it must certainly be gratifying to him to have his views sustained by our court of last resort."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Norfolk", "Western", "Railroad"], "snippet": "of June, 1893, the <mark>Norfolk</mark>  <mark>Western</mark> <mark>Railroad</mark> Com pany was indicted"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Norfolk", "Western", "Railroad"], "snippet": "of June, 1893, the <mark>Norfolk</mark>  <mark>Western</mark> <mark>Railroad</mark> Com pany was indicted"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Bray, aged tblrty-slx yean, was found dead In bis bouse In Danville. The body was suspended by a rope from the top of a door frame, and from its condition the act must have been committed early tn the week. No one bos been staying in the house with Mr. Bray recently. On July 20 last Bray carried his wife and child to her fathers, at Christie, Va., and returned to Danville In a despondent mood. On August 27 he sold his interest in the Carter Maoblne Company to his partner, and stnee then had made several efforts to buy an Interest in established bouses here but without suocess. For several months past Bray had aoted strangely, and there is not much doubt but that constant brooding on some trouble, which he did not disclose, had affected his mind. Walter Witt, a brakeman on the Virginia Midland Division of the Southern Railway, was instantly killed at Staunton river bridge. Witt was passing over the cars on a freight train and his bead was struck by one of the beams of the bridge structure. The body was taken to Danville where Witt resided. The young brakeman had been marrlod only two weeks.

Ford has returned to Lynch burg from Richmond and Norfolk, where he secured a pardon for W. E. Turner, former ly of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, who has been in the penitentiary for three years. It seems that Turner was the victim of a conspiracy of his wife, who accused him of an assault on her daughter, for which he was sentenced In the Corporation Court of Norfolk to ten years in the penitentiary. After the trial his wife secured a divorce and married an Englishman. Affidavits were made showing that her people admitted that It was a job put up on Turner by his wife, and it was on the strength of these that he was pardoned. The barn and contents, embracing farm ing Implements and about 600 bushels of wheat, on what is known as the Cassidy farm, near Waterford, now owned by Mrs. H. O. Gross, was ttoally destroyed by fire. Mr. Roger Jones farms the place and had housed his wheat crop in the barn, which was a very large one. He was thrashing his wheat, the thrasher being in the barn and the engine just outside. A spark Ignaled the straw and everything went up In flames. The thrasher belongod to George Fry.
