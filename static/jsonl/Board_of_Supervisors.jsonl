The general reassessment was called for by the Buckingham County Board of Supervisors, The last .general reassessment was conducted in 1976. Virginia Law requires reassessments to be con ducted every four years, but a reassessment may be delayed one or two years if desired by the Board of Supervisors. For the present cycle, the Board of Supervisors chose a five-year interval. State Law requires real estate to be assessed at its fair market value.  The Board of Supervisors decision to conduct a reassessment now was in fluenced by a State Depart ment of Taxation study. That study showed , the average real estate parcel was assessd at 78 of its estimated fair market value as of 1978. The study also indicated Some disparitylBWWeen the assessment or various Cate gories of real estate. During times of high inflation, it is expected that rapid changes in land values would increase the difference bet ween the assessed value and the actual fair market value. The Board of Supervisors has hired appraisers to assist the Board of Asses sors with the reassessment. The appraiser will visit every parcel in the County, make an initial estimate of its value, and present that information to the Board of Assessors foi its review. Three members of the Board of. assessors will meet with the appraisers on an . average of one day per week to review the appraisers work.

Canteloupes have not been so in evidence and grapes received a severe shock from the early frost while the local peach crop has been a wide spread fail ure. Some newspaper scribbler wus silly enough to attack the health record of Farmvil le, and never was greater injustice done a place and people. I called but yesterday on a family recently come from Kan sas to make their home with us, and the good wife of the household remarked that she came to Virginia, Southside Virginia, in seaich of health and that she had found it. She had suffered for years from a distressing case of nasal catarrh, which had broken in upon the rest of night ar.d the comfort of day. The old enemy had been vanquish ed and she now enjoys the inesti mable blessings of good health, and all this in a community which scribbler describes as a pest hole. Strange that a man who started out to write falsely should have been bold enough to fly in the face of facts so well established. Now and then the cry sounds out from our jail for the jailor and on repairing to the place Mr. Bliss finds that the prisoners are fighting among themselves. Human punish ment as a corrective is a dead fail ure. The ruling passion losef none of its force behind prison bars. Our lithia water requires no ice anil so is the most economical of summer drinks. Judge Watkins made an irnpres sive speech before the Board of Su pervisors on last Saturday in the interest of our public school system Some of our good people dont yet understand that education costs something, that is that it should cost them something. A farmer in town the other day said his crops were never so good and that he had not had a drop too much of rain. Some farmers never have too much or too little. Prof. Thornton has decided not to accept the position offered him in the University of West Virginia. Miss Snow, of the Normal Facul ty, is the first to return for the work of another session. It looks like yesterday when vacation began. Tiire flies and sessions and vaca- cations fly with it. Some of our merchants are busy taking inventory. All of them have done well during the dull mouths of summer. The extra passenger traiu of the Tidewater  Western is being well patronized. Our people are complainiug of the injury done to the public roads of ihe county by the saw mill ua gone. At a recent meeting of the Board of Supervisors for Priice Edward, a license of 3 was placed on such vehicles. Scraping dirt to the middle of the road beds is a positive nuisance and ought to be prohibited by law. It simply means one prolonged and intensified mud- hole. There are so many premium ba bies in town that a baby show is in order, but woe to the rash mortals who conseut to serve as judges. An officer of a Confederate regi ment during the closing days of the war, called on the late Col. K. A Booker, who was then in charge of the Randolph House, for the use of a horse and left a valuable gold watch as security for its return. The hone was never returned and a daughter of Col. Booker still wears the watch. Within the recent past a letter has been received at the Herald office from a citizen of South Carolina m iking inquiries of the watch. The silence stretching over a period of more than 40 years is more than remarkable. Speaking of war incidents reminds me that Gen. Lee, on the retreat to Appo mattox, s p e n t a n i g h t at the Randolph Home, aud the night following Gen. Graut occupied the same apntmeuts, and the story goes that Gen. Lee left his tooth bru h and that Gen. Grant took possession of it History doesnt say that it was surrendered at Ap pomattox.

Pear son, and after hearing the evi dence the Judge gave him a sentence of 5 years in the peni tentiary. A nother was the case of a1 boy named Moses Patteson, who had broken intoj the store of C. I. Johnson  non a t W ingina. This boy was-Bent to the colored ref or- m itory for two years. The other was the case of John Clarke tried on the charge ot breakings into the dwelling house of J . Munro H arris, and he got 2 years in the peniten tiary. The case against John G arnett, charged w ith killing James Maxey, was tried before a jury and he was acquitted. Judge H ail was local counsel for G arnett and H. M. Smith, of Richmond, was also here for his defence. The case was subm itted w ithout argum ent and was speedily disposed of by the jury. Mr. Sm ith fully sustained his reputation as a crim inal law yer in his exami nation of the witnesses, and jie had lho laws of evidence a t his finger ends. A nother oaae th at attracted considerable a t tention was th a t of Payne against Baber. This was a case Where the plaintiff asked for 1,000 damage which he claimed resulted from saw dust having been run into his mill pond Yy the defendant. The jury awarded dam ages in the sum of 200 00. A. L. P itts Jr. was engaged on one side and his law partner, F. 0. Moon, on the other in this case. The way this happened was th at Mr. Pitts was engaged in the case before he and Mr. Moon became partners. E W. Hub- ard, our able attorney for the Commonwealth, was a vigor ous prosecutor of the criminal cases before the Court, and is looking well again after his long spell of sickness. Aubrey E. Strode motered here from Lynchburg and was in attend ance a part of the session of Court. The G. and Jury for the May term of Court was an excellent one, indeed the per sonal of this jury was such th at it would be difficult to im prove on it. A. Hi Clement, of Appomattox, was here as an attorney and insuiance man and he seemed to be busy W iiiia rn Horner, of Rosemary, N.

Mayor S. R . Lawson said that Wiley I and Wilson, Lynchburg, ad Han-  kins and Anderson, Richmond,  had both sent letters giving es timated costs for their work to design and supervise the con struction. Present System Inadequate Mayor Lawson said that Ro bert Je kins, a representative bf the Water Control Board was  unaware as to wihat we were doing to provide more sewage facilities for the town. Lawson quoted Jenkins as saying that the Water Control Board was getting ready to put Appomattox on a  permit basis because the pre sent sewage system is overload ed. This would have meant that no other home or business place could tie in to the sewage sys tem without a state permit. Because of the plans to con- ! struct the sewage lagoon, how ever, Jenkins said the Water Control Board would probably shelve their plans to place Appo mattox on a restricted basis. Ivey Holland said,  I think we stand at a place where were going to have to take action. The Council then decided to let the Finance Committee plus the i Town Manager go to Farmville to check costs of a sewage la goon system there. New Voting Precinct The Mayor also reported that  we have people voting in town who do not live in town, and have never lived in town. Approximately 1200- vote in the Soubhside magisterial district ac- Loordipg j to Lawsons estimate, yrith bout 600 voting in town. We want people in town paying town taxes to be able to decide on town matters. , Council voted to request the Board of Supervisors to petition Circuit Court to create a separ ate voting precinct for the Town of Appomattox. Whether this would mean a new registration for voters could not be deter mined.
