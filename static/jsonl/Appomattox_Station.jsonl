His designs were thwarted, how ever, b ecause Confederated burned the bridges over the James and because the river was too swollen to be crossed on the pontoons he had brought for that purpose. He therefore proceeded to destroy rail and brides north of Richmond. The fall of the capitol was at hand. Out of desperation, the Confederate high command evolved a plan. A surprise attack was to cripple Grants army, making it possible to hold Richmond and Petersburg with a reduced force. Lee was then to move south on the railroad, join Johnston, and crush Sherman. That done, the united Confederate forces could return to defeat Grant. This was purely unrealistic, but it was attempted - and failed.
