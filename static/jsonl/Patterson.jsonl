D. Flood, and as indicative of how entirely he deserves our highest es teem. Notwithstanding the inclement weather a large crowd attended Buckingham court Sept. 18. Hon. H. D. Flood was advertised to address the Democracy, and he proved to be a drawing card. At 12 oclock the meeting was called to order, and Hon. Camm Patterson, the Democratic nominee for the Legislature, led off in a short, timely, impressive speech devoted to the arraignment of the Third party, showing the fallacies of the platform, and the foolishness of their demands. He was listened to throughout with marked attention and was enthusiastically applauded from start to the finish. Mr. H. D. Flood followed Captain Patterson, and delighted his audience with finished oratory and overwhelm ing arguments. He reviewed the his tory of the Democratic party, and at tributed the conception and establish ment of onr most cherished institu tions to its broad patriotism and statesmanship. His speech was bold and aggressive, and he had the effect of warming up and setting to work many who were indifferent. Several other distinguished gentlemen made short speeches, after which the meet ing adjonrned, enthused and in g eat good humor. Prior to the meeting of the Demo cracy, the Populists met in conven tion, and nominated L. C. Moseley as their candidate for the Legislature. Mr. Moseley has hitherto been a Democrat, and as such has held the office of Sheriff, and served also in. the Legislature. Personally he is a man of influence, and will develop some strength. Hon. E. R. Cocke made his appear ance here before the Convention, and was warmly greeted by those of his faith. He declined a joint debate with Messrs. Patterson and Flood on any terms, and addressed his own crowd. It is at once perceptible that Captain Cocke is not a trained public speaker. His effort was laborious and studied and not calculated to arouse enthusiasm, yet he leaves the impression of being a well informed and scholarly gentleman. His bear ing was dignified and courteous, and upon the whole he made a fair im pression upon his hearers. His vote in this county will not be large, for the Democracy is spendidly organiz ed, alert and vigilant.Richmond Times."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Patterson"], "snippet": "order, and Hon.

This action was taken by a vote of 53 to 21, and followed a discussion of nearly three hours. An amendment confining the increase to Cabinet of ficers and the presiding officers of the Senate and House was voted down, as was also a proposition to postpone the increase until 1913. The increase becomes effective March 4, 1909.

A conference committee was ap pointed as to the other matters of disagreement between the House and Senate on the Legislative Bill. In the debate which proceeded the adoption of the salary increase pro position, Mr. Berry contended that 5,000 was not a grossly inadequate salary for senators and members of Congress. He denied that they could not live on that amount. There is not one-half of them, he declared, who ever could or did make 5,000 a year engaged in any other busi ness. Senator Nelson offered an amend ment confining the increase to the vice president, speaker and cabinet officers, and spoke in support of it. He said We as legislators are paid higher than legislators of any oilier .country. Mr. Nelson then gave fig ures showing the salaries paid to legislators in European countries, and, continuing his argument, spoke with resentment of the idea that legislators were here as laborers for a salary. Theirs was a post of honor, and pay enough to live mod estly was sufficient. We do not want to enter the social world, he asserted. He then expressed satis faction that some senators and mem bers have ambition in that line, and have the means to mingle socially with diplomats, etc. Mr. Gallinger supported the pro posed Increase. He said be believed public opinion was in favor of the increase. We have been increasing salaries all along the line except our own. Each member must make political contributions. This was just, he said, and so were many oth er demands which could not be evad ed. He said the entire extra expense to the government would be only about 1,000,000 annually. Mr. Lodge, in favoring the in crease, said that members of the English Parliament received no sal aries that the Irish members, who were poor, received contributions from the people of their districts and from this country that the labor members were paid by their labor unions. This, he asserted, was a bad system, and he believed Great Britain was coming to recognize -ft. AN INDIAN SLAYER.

A very sad of case drowning occurd at Mauteo Station on the C.  O. R. R. on Friday the 12th, instant. Jesse Moseley a highly respected colored man, who carries the mail from Man- teo P. O. in Buckingham county across the river to the Station, with two section hands undertook to cross the river in a skiff. The river was very high, the current too strong for them. They were carried against the wire rope of the ferry which caught theboat and upset it, and the three men were thrown in the river.. Mosley managed to catch hold of the wire rope and held on to it for over I anhonr, when he let go fromexhaus-1 tion and being unable to swim he was drowned. The other two men swam I , to Sycamore Island aud climed a tree j where they had to stay until a mes-1 senger could go to Wingina for a boat and help, when they were res cued from their fearful situation almost frozen. While Jesse Mosley was holding to the rope Mr. Geo, W. Patterson, a Merchant at Manteo, offered 100 to any one who would rescue him, several attemps were made but each one failed thie cur rent being too strond. j During the great freshet of 18701 Jesse Mosley rescued a young lady I a Mrs wright, from the same tree the two men climed. She was in a house I that floated down until it struck the island and dashed to pieces, when the young lady escaped nrowhing by climbing this tree. Mrs John R. Agee whose illness I reported several weeks ago died on Sunday night the 6th, iinstant and was hurried Tuesday at the family I burying ground. She was about 70 years old, a consistant member of the j  Baptist Church, and highly esteemed bv all who knew her. Her husband and four sous survive her, and to them we extend our deepest sympa thy in this sorce berevemeut. Mr. J. Jas Ranson has been quite sick again for the last two weeks, and is still confined to his room, it is very doubtful if he can leave the house before the spring.
