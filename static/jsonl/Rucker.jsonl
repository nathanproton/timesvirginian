Bryan was the central figure in an historic scene Saturday, when he signed the proclamatioii making ef fective the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, an amendment which provides that United States Senators shall be elected by direct vote of the people. , From this day on the States must follow the new constitutional mandate in selecting their Senators or else go unrepresented in the upper branch of Congress. No Senator now holding a seat in that body, however, is affected dicing his current term of office. The ceremony was simple, though necessarily formal.

With the second the Secre tary signed the word Jennings, then handing the pen to Representative, Rucker. The third was used in writ ing the word Bryan, and this the Secretary kept himself. The date of the proclamation was written with the fourth pen, which Senator Borah re ceived as a memento. As soon .as the signature had been affixed Mr. Bryan expressed gratifica tion over the fact that the duty of officially announcing the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment had fal len to him as Secretary of State.
