Everyone knows what a crowd there was the last night,almost impossible for late comers to get seats. However, after much contriving and the be stowal of some of their sweetest smiles on one of the good looking ushers, our two girls managed to get possession of a chair in the aisle and the crowd closed in around them. Soon along came a candidate talking politics for all be was worth. So much interested was he that he seemed not to be aware of the exist ence of our two pretty girls and leaned right over them, talking to two men on the opposite side of the aisle. One of the girls whispered, Mercy on ns, whatever shall we do He will sit down on us directly. It was then that the little pin got in its work, and you can just bet your life Mr. Editor that that can didate forgot to talk politics, for rhat evening at least. What be came of the two pretty girls? Oh they were left in undisputed poa session of their chair during t.1 e re mainder of the exercises, and the little pin, ah, that is a secret known only to the candidate.

Mott Robertson, late county- treasurer, who resigned that office last summer, has announced to sono of his friends that he will stand fo the Democratic nomination for tb clerkship, and that he will, if elect ed, run the office for the fees alone This would be a saving to the tax payers of nearly 600 per annum, or nearly 5,000 for th\u00e8 term.

Should he enter the race, he would undoubtedly have the warm support of Mr. George T. Peers, the present clerk  and Mr. Peers would, no doubt, remain in the office for a time to aid him in his work. Mr. J Rolfe Horsley, whom Mr. Peers de feated for the office in 1899, is also likely to be a candidate. Mr. Hors ley last Week resigned the position of private secretary to Congressman Flood, which oarried a salary of 1, 200 per annum paid by Congress and assumed the management of the Southside Virginian. The resigna tion of Mr. Horsley probably caused Dr. Robertsons early announcement of his candidacy. We are satisfied that there will be other candidates. The people are being quietly sounded as to thiB and that man, bat the great majority of them will hardly bind themselves to any one at this stage of the game- none, perhaps, except a few whc be lieve that they ought to be allowed  to shape all the public policies of the connty, and to name all of the officeholders years in advance of the election.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Party Organization. Much Enthusiasm. Large Attend ance. Pursuant to a call of Dr. D. M. Robertson, Chairman, of the Citizens Party a large and enthusiastic meeting of citi zens assembled in mass meet ing at the Courthouse here Fri day and adopted a platform of principles and practically put a full tioket in the field for all County and District1 officers in opposition to the nominees of the Democratio party. Every seat in the Courthouse was oc cupied and m an were stand ing in the aisles. The crowd was estimated at 200.  Many of these, however, were specta tors, and not in sympathy with the movement. Dr. L. M. Robertson, Chair man, appointedthe following Committee on Resolutions J. W. Cawthorn Jr., R. S. Jen kins, David Alvis, E. F. Col- lips, S. P. Coleman and J. T. jGotas. While the committee was out J. P. L. Fleshman addressed the meeting. Mr. Fleshman has been a Republican for many years his remarks were direct ed against the office-holders of Appqmattox County, particu larly for raising the assessed values and the rate of taxation he referred to a notice posted by the Superintendent of Schools, 1800 for schools and 1700 for incidentals. He wanted the receipts and dis bursements published of the school fund, also the road fund and the Supervisors proceed ings. He wants Appomattox to sell her poor houses and pay her debts, two poor houses and three paupers is too expensive, he deolared. He opposed a bond issue, saying it would make slaves of the people. The Committee on Resolu tions then made its report and the chair requested J.- W. Caw- thon, the Chairman, to ex- lain to the meeting the reso- utions they were unanimously adopted. We, the citizens of Appomat tox County in mass-meeting assembled at the Courthouse of said county on this the 20th day of August, 1915 desirous of promoting our own welfare and that of every other - citizen of our county do make the fol lowing declaration of princi ples and for the support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our influence and our votes. We demand a more economi cal administration of our State and county affairs, and that all taxes and licenses be eq a- ized as nearly as possible and that the poll tax be made col lectible as other taxes and abolished as a prequisite to voting. We demand the repeal of the aw appointing the  board of review to do over the work al ready performed by the -con? missioners of the revenue, as this is a useless waste of money and very objectionable to the people. We believe that it is detri mental to the best interests of the people for any county offi cial to bold office for a period of more than two terms, as ex perience has proved that many of them become seif-perpetuat ing political bosses, thus caus ing a detriment to the public welfare. We demand that the expen sive, antiquated system of deeds and mortgages be discon tinned and a modern system be adopted, such as the Torrens system, whioh would be a sav ing to the people of Virginia of a half million to one million dollars a year. We demand that the State publish and distribute its school books at cost, which would mean a large annual saving to our people.

E ditor T imbs  I saw an editorial in your excel lent paper some time ago, regarding a graded school at this place. I heartily concur with you about it. It is a good idea, and one that onr citizens shonld take hold of and stop talking of it as an impossibility. Certainly, there is nothing more needed in this vicinity than a good school. Look around here and see what poor advantages onr children have, oompared with the children of other counties. Prince Edward has, within its borders, both a male and female college. Buckingham,through the munificence of Gen. T. M. Lo gan, has a splendid graded school Charlotte and Campbell children both have advantages that are denied ours. If yon will stop a minute yon can see how easy we can get a school here, at a very little coat to any one person. If yon will allow me I will suggest a plan to get it np Suppose some of the leading young men take this m atter in hand and start a subscription to raise funds. We only need abont 500 to start on, and I am certain that the people of old Appomattox can raise it with very little trouble. I wonld Bnggest that Sheriff S. P. Coleman take one of the subscrip tion lists around, as he has proven himself very good at that kind of work and he wonld be particularly interested in this m atter as he has some little ones yet to be educated. Mr. R. F. Burke wonld also make an efficient solicitor, and he is deeply interested in the m atter. There are a number of others I could mention who will do all in their power for the school. I am a great believer in hitting while the iron is hot. - Now, as public opinion is some what aroused on this snbject, let the good people of Appomattox have a mass meeting to put the scheme on foot at once. As yon said in yonr editorial on this snbject, Rome was not bnilt in a day but I never saw a school house as large as the city of Rome, however. It will be remem bered that the founders of Rome went to work and worked hard until it was quite a city, well fortified. We do not wish to build a Rome, bnt a good school. Now let every man p at his shchlder to the wheel, and I am confident a suitable school house will be erected at this place in the nettfrfuture. J.
