One major reason for this rating is found in the basic training every marine recruit re ceives in boot camp at either Parris Island, S. C., or San Diego, Calif. Key figures in putting thousands of recruits through this rigorous six- weeks period of training are groups of versatile non-commissioned offi cers known as Drill Instructors. The DIs, as they are called, work in pairs. JCs recruits arriv\u00e9 from \u00efvery corner of the nation, they are formed into platoons of from 66 to 74 men and each platoon is placed under the charge of a duo of DIs. It then becomes the duty of the Drill Instructors to transform some 70 men from every walk of life farmers, mechanics, accountants, reporters, truck drivers, schoolboys into a trained, disciplined group of men who walk, talk, think and act in the best marine manner. The average age of their charges is 20. And they have just six weeks for the task. The DIs must guide their men through intensive practice in drill ing, manual of arms, combat prin ciples, dressing, shooting the rifle and pistol, throwing the hand gre nade and handling the bayonet. The DIs must be good teachers in order to give instructions in first aid, field sanitation, military cour tesy, guard duty, scouting and pa trolling, security on the march and other subjects with which ev ery marine is expected to be fa miliar. They must set an example in mili tary courtesy, neatness, military bearing and countless regulation proceedings. Probably most important of all, however, the Drill Instructors teach discipline. They teach men to obey orders without question  to do what they are told, when they are told, whatever the orders may be. At the end of the boot period, the platoon of well-trained marines leaves for advanced work at special schoolsbut the DIs remain behind. They get the evening offand start in the folowing day with 66 to 74 new recruits.
