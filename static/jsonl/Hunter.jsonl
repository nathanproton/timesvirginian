Oh, you must be mistaken, remon strated Mr. Laldlaw.  .Not at all, it was palpable and meant. You see, I had my working clothes on and the grime of honest labor shocked her sensitive spirit. Hm! muttered the old man thoughtfully, and then he went to his lawyer. See here, Hunter, he began lo the attorney. Im doing that boy a wrong. in what way? was the pertinent query. Mr. Laidlaw narrated his story of the disadvantages of menial employment in the eyes of the higher sociul set. He further deplored the arduous labor which was hardening the hands of his protege, the slow promise of final ad vancement. The lawyer chuckled. Tired of the program, eh, already that I laid out to make a real man of your nephew? he challenged. What you want to dorear him in the lap of luxury and spoil him? Welleryou see No, you see! Laidlaw, Interrupted the lawyor briskly, Tve been studying I young Robert and Im glad to observe his sense, courage and fidelity to an ideal. Hell work out right and make you proud of him if you leave him alone. Yes, but he may make friends among the well, the lowlythat may be a detriment to him. What! rallied the lawyer, after our proud-tempered Miss Carring- on? Rut suppose he should fall in love with some poor girl? Suppose he did? Do you want to spoil his happiness? No, you go right ahead on the course we have marked out. Robert is no fortune hunter or he wouldnt havo chosen you instead of your brother, he would never have isked catching an heiress by under taking menial employment. Hes gen uine, concluded the attorney. True blue ail through and ail of the time, liell land right. Mark my words. There came a test. An unexpected event transpired. James Laidlaw died and in a will he had planned to change when his nephew refused to live with him, but which he had neglected to do, his sole heir was Robert. Now hell go off on his own hook, 1 suppose, grumbled Mr. Laidlaw to his lawyer no further use for me. I Wait and see, advised the law yer. It was a week later when Robert came into the library and addressed his relative. Uncle Henry, he said bluntly, I want you to accept half of the fortune Uncle James left me. You were closer to him than 1 am, and should by right inherit it. You are not rich Who told you that? exploded the old man. If Ive hidden my wealth from you, it was for a purpose. All the same, he said in a lower tone, Im glad to see that you have a loyal, grateful heart. Its a division, no matter what you say, declared Robert, you see, If we could all live together Wearent we? What you up to now? demanded the old man suspi ciously. Whyyou see, theres a Nellie. And who is she? Let me bring her around and see, suggested Robert, which he did. She was not of the horn princess typeonly a modest, retiring girlbut inside of five minutes she had wound herself about the old mans ingenuous heart just as she had done with Robert Laidlaw."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Hunter"], "snippet": "his lawyer.

They are pursued from youth to manhood, and from manhoodto old age. Very distinguished are Lord Staf fords hoUnus, the Earl ot Yarboroughs honnds, and Qaeen Victoria pays eight thousand live hundred dollars per year to her Master Ot Backhonnds. But all of them put together do not equal in number or speed, or power to hunt down, the great kennel ot hounds ot which Sin and Trouble are owner and master. Bnt what Is a relief forall this pursuit ot trouble, and annoyance, and pain, and be reavement? My text gives It to you In a word of three letters, bat each letter is a harlot if you would triumph, or a tbron If yon want to be orownod, or a lake It yon would slake yonr thirstyes, a chain ot three lakesO-O-D, tbe One for whom David longed, and the One whom David found. You might ns well meet a stag whleb, after Its sixth mile of running at the top most speed through thicket and. gorge, and with the brehth Of the dogs on Its heels,has come in fnll sight ot Serooh Lake, and try to ctjbl Its projeetlng and blistered tongue with a drop of dew from a blado ot gloss,ns to at tempt to satisfy an Immortal soul,when fly ing from trouble and sin, with anything less deep, and high, and broad, and immense, and Infinite, and eternal tiian God. Hto comfort, wby it embosoms all distress. Hls arm, it wrenches off aU bondage. Hls hand, It wipes away all tears. His Obrlstly atone ment, It makes us all right with the past, and all right with the future all right with God, all right with man, and all right for ever. Lamartine tells us tbat King Nimrod said to hls three sons, Hero aro three yokes, and one is ot clay, another of amber, and another ot gold. Choose now which yon will have. The eldest son, having first ohoice, chose the vase of gold, on whloh was written the word Empire, and when opened it was found to contain human blood. The second son, making tho next, choice, ohose the vase ot aml0r.Jns with the 1 nuTwM f openod I  jUma the ashes of these who were Called great. The third son took tho of clay, and, oponing It, found it _ ptv bat on the bottom of it was in- scrlral the name ot God. King Nimrod asked bis oourtlers whloh vase they thought weghed the most. The avaricious men ot hiseourt said the vase of gold. The poets said the one of amber. But tho wisest men said the empty vase, because ono letter ot the name of God outwoighed a universe. For Him I thirst for Hte gram I beg on Hls promise I build my all. Without Him I cannot be happy. I have tried the world, and it does well enough as far it goes, but It Is too uncertain a world, too evanescent a world. I am not a prejudiced witness. I have nothing against this world. I have been one of the most fortunate, or to use a more Christian word, one of the most blessed of menblessed in my parents, blessed ln the place of my nativity, blessed In my health, blessed ln my field of work, blessed in my natural temperament, blessed In my family, blessed in my opportunities, blessed in a comfortable livelihood, blessed In the ho,e that my soul will go to Heaven through the pardoning mercy ot God, and niy body, unless it be lost at sea or cre mated in some conflagration, will He down ln the gardens of Groenwood among my kindred and friends, some already gone and others to come after me. Life to many has been n disappointment, bnt to me It bas been a pleasant surprise, and yet I de clare that It I did not feel tbat God was now my Friend and ever-present help, I should be wretched and t error at icken. But I want more of Him. I have thought over this text aud preached this sermon to myself until with all the arouse.l energies of my body, mind and soul, I can ory out, As tbe liart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Theo, O God. Ob, when some of yon get there it will be like what a hunter tells of when push ing his eanoe far up North ln the winter and amid the Ice-floes, and a hundred miles, as he thought, from any other human be ings! He was startled ono day as he heard astepplng on the ice, and he cocked his rifle ready to meet unythlng that came near. He found a man, barefooted and In sane from long exposure, approaching him. Taking him into bis canoe and kindling fires to warm him, he restored him and found out where be had lived, and took him to hls home, and found all the village ln great excitement. A hundred men were searching for the lost man, and bis family and friends rushed out to meet him and, as had been agreed at hls first appearance, bells were rung, and guns were fired, and banquets spread, and the rescuer loaded with presents. Well, when some ot yon step oat of this wilderness, where yon have been chilled and torn ag sometimes lost amid the Iceberg warm greetings of all tbe villages  th e glorified, and your friends rush o u t to give you weleomlng kiss, the news that th e r e to another soul forever saved will c all th e caterers ot Heaven to spread tho banquet and the bell-men to lay hold of the ro p e in the tower, and while tbe ehallees eliek at the feast, and the bells clang from the tur rets, it will be a scene so uplifting I p ra y God I may be there to take part in th e celestial merriment. Until tbe d a y break and the shadows flee away, be th o u like a roe or a young hart upon the mouse tains of Bether."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["hunter"], "snippet": "be like what a <mark>hunter</mark> tells of when push"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["hunter"], "snippet": "be like what a <mark>hunter</mark> tells of when push"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The Commission has under con sideration the acquisition of the hunt ing and fishing rights in the foreat lands owned by the United States Gov ernment in the State, aggregating 600.000 acres, to be re-stocked and opened as public hunting and fishing grounds, and of acquiring, by lease or purchase for similar purposes, areas in other sections of the State where there are no Federally owned forest lands, and likewise of establishing certain sanctuaries or game refuges where game birds and animals can be raised in the native State, to be trap ped and distributed to other sections where most needed. The Commission is also considering the establishment of two fish hatcheries for the re-stoek- ing of the bass and trout streams and ponds in the State. The survey of the work of the Com mission for the past fiscal year indi cates the importance of its activities and the efficiency with which the task is being handled. Great possibilities lie in store for it in restoring Virginia to its pristine claim of being a hun ters paradise, and its work entitles it to the hearty support and co-operation of the farmers and conservationists of the Commonwealth. During the course of the day the ad- ! visory committees appointed by the! Commission had conferences and made recommendations. The recom- ! mandations of two of the committees  follow Recommendations of Advisory Com mittee on Upland Game 1. We are firmly of the opinion that the Commission of Gpma and Inland Fisheries should be given full regu- ! latory powers as are new vested in the  boards of supervisor. W think that the Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries is in a better position to know about bag limits, seasons, etc., in all sections of the State. 2. General game and fish laws should be codified and simplified.  We are of the opinion that the State Game Farm should continue to rail quail, and recommend that in the distribution of these quail to the dif ferent sanctuaries that particular at tention should be given to the sane tuarics on which birds will be re leased, ascertaining if the parties who propose to provide these sanctuaries are properly interested in game con servation and whether the place is a proper one on which to put game. We recommend that tha present method of distributing quail from the farm be carefully Investigated, as we ate of the opinion that If birds are held longer and not released so young bet ter results will be obtained. 4. We are inclined to recommend that a license be put on cats. The committee is of the opinion that hunt ing eats are more destructive to up land game than any other varmint. 5. The committee does nbt think there should be any change, in the present license law. We are firmly of the opinion that the fee of three dollars Is low enough snd should not be changed. 6. This committee also recommends that a law be passed prohibiting the use of any gun fpr upland game that shoots over twice. 7. We recommend that some law be passed that all dogs be tied up in reeding season, or if allowed to run at large to be compelled to wear a muzzle. 8. We recommend that every hunter e required to dieuplay his licenae. -Recommendations tor Advisory Com mittee oq Fur Bearing Animals 1. No hunting of rabbits when snow is on the ground. 2. Squirrel season to open and dose with the quail season. 3. Close season on bears. 4. Trappers to pay 10.00 licenae and 16.00 for non-reaidenta. Trappers to report to Commission of Game and \u00efn- and Fisheries number of traps and ilo all animals and varmints So raught. Trappers must be compelled -o visjt traps at least once a day. 5. Fur industry to Virginia is val- lable and should be protected and its peration should come under a State .W. 6. A law prohibiting dropping cate ,n highways. 7. Regulation of laws be left in ands of Commission of Game and In- and Fisheries. 8. Foxhuntera to pay hunting iccnse. Resolutions Passed The following resolutions were pass- 1 by the gathering 1. It is the sense of this body, com posed of these advisory committees, hat the Commission of Game and In- and Fisheries should have given it by he Legislature regulatory powers ow exercised by the Boards of Super io rs . 2. It is the sense of this body tist he reports submitted, by the advisory orqtnittees he turned over to the Commission for deliberation and ccc mmendation and their report be urned over ,to the Legislature.

Dr. Mack I. Shanholbz, State Health Commissioner, notes that the months of November, December and February generally show the largest incidence of reported cases of this disease. Through October of this year, 19 cases have been list ed. Last year there were 26 re ported cases and in 1954 there were 46. Hunters were warned by Dr. Shanholtz to .take every precaution to avoid contracting tularemia which, though rarely fatal, is troublesome and often painful. Al though many wild animals may be infected with tularemia, the .disease occurs most ffequently among wild rabbits, he said. Other animals which can be a source of infection are the tree squirrel, woodchuck, quail, skunk, opossum, deer, fox, and even domesticated animals such as ithe oat or dog. Man becomes infected through the handling of infected animals, such as in skinning or dressing, or by the bate of infected flies or ticks, acocrdiing to the Commission er. He pointed out that in June and July of this year, there were 10 re ported cases of tularemia, most of them attributed to ticks. Tularemia can also be transmitted by eating insufficiently cooked rabbit meat. He also cautioned that freezing the meat does not kill the tularemia bacteria. The onset of the disease is sud den, with chilly, headache, vomit ing, aching, weakness, and always fever. The patient usually is pros trated and confined to bed. An ul cer may appear at the sit4 of infec tion with swelling of the lymph glands in nearby parts of the body. In recent years the antibiotics have been used in the treatment of tu laremia, reducing the duration of the illness from months to weeks. Although convalescence is usually slow, recovery is followed by per manent immunity. Prevention of the disease is mainly a matter of personal pre caution by the hunter or anyone handling wild animals, the Com missioner stated. Sportsmen should avoid shooting slow-moving rab bits and should never pick up mb bits that are fiounid dead or can be killed with a club. These rabbits probably have tularemia. Dr. Shanholtz emphasized, that any person who may be handling raw wild rabbits, such as the hunt er, trapper, housewife, or cook, should wear rubber golves to give protection against contracting tu laremia. Make sure these gloves are leak-proof. Avoid cuts by knives or sharp ends of animal bones while dressing or cooking wild rabbit. Do not touch or rub your eye with your hand. He also pointed out that any small white or grayidh spots no tic ed on the liver of a rabbit are pro bably turaremic abscesses or ulcere. Such a carcass should be be burned and Ithe hands wadhed thoroughly with soap and water. Antiseptic or disinfectant should be used on all open cuts."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["hunter"], "snippet": "pre caution by the <mark>hunter</mark> or anyone handling wild"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["hunter"], "snippet": "pre caution by the <mark>hunter</mark> or anyone handling wild"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

They were in formed with an indifferent smile, that they had other important du ties and home affairs claiming their time, and their quarters could be better spent elsewhere than on the dead. In one seuse this is true. We have home duties and try not to neglect them, aud the monev ould be possibly more wisely spent While we do this to honor our dead, we try also to impress npo. the minds of the children of the county, hat the Confederate cause was just .ml right and thatthir fathers were not rebellious traitors and to give them a desire to acquire knowledge of the events of their country, and to teach, them to be patriotic aud proud of their South-land and an cestors. The little knowledge, be ginning here may grow in the minds and hearts of each, and be of great benefit to all. The president of the U. D. C. thought last year of giviug up the charter of the Appo mattox Chapter U. D. C. on account of the ladies lack of interest in this county. She wrote the National l D. C. president, and the Virginia president U. D. C. to that effect, stating she would join a chapter in Lynchburg. Letters from the Va. division, S. C. division and Md. di vision came pouring in not to let Appomattox surrender the second time also sending a list of names of prominent ladies who would join among them, Miss Ruth Early, Mrs. James Garnett, Miss M. Amelia Smith, the piesideut of Va. division U. D. C. and the daughter of ex-Gov Wm. Smith of Va., known as Ex tra Billy. The letter expressed surprise at the Appomattox ladies not caring to join one of the largest organizations m the whole south and living in one of the most his torical counties in the world. It is quite a reflection upon the county. We revised the roll and now have ouly eighteen members lu t they say they intend to keep up the or ganization and to be proud they are U. O C. of Appomattox and we shall be more than pleased if Coal ing will forward us the names ot the ladies desiring to join the IT, D.

W. Hunter, president of U. D. C. West Appomattox. One prominent aim of the U. D. C. is to gather histori cal facts to help the historians of the U. D. 0. historical committee in collecting war experiences, inci dents and reminiscences of the old soldiers, their wives, daughters or any one who can remember during the Civil war. The U. D. C. es pecially requests, Mrs. T. W. Johns to write up hers and Capt. Johns also Mrs. George Miles, Mrs. A. H. Bocock, Major Flood, Mr. Chap Chilton, Drs. Wm. White and Wm. H. Ahbitt, Mrs. Mary Ann Robert son, Mr. Kirk Hannah and any one who will help us, also send us news paper clippings or Magazines or Journals or anything bearing on the war between the states.
