Jones and John Overton as clerks. After nine votes had been regularly polled, negro named Henry Hughes weut into the booth to get Constable Mar tin to fix his ticket. Mr. Martin told him he would assist him by pointing ont the names to him.

The negro then folded the ticket up and without makiug the slightest com plaint voted it. He weut out and iu about ten minutes Mr. E. F.

Loaves of bread of varying size and quality were made ten or more years ago. They were round oaves and square loaves, flat oaves and tall loaves, little oaves and big loaves, made and aked in a thousand different ways. Visitors to the fair will find that an entirely different kind of oaf is being made today. The modern loaf weighs about a pound and is baked in a tin of standard size. Housewives are using practically the same re cipes. Judges say bread made in this way is much superior. Styles in pies, doughnuts, cakes and cookies have changed just as much in recent years as as they have with bread. Im proved recipes have been worked out in every field by students of cooking and adopted by the American housewife.

Saturday evening the largest crowd ever seen on the base ball field here assembled to witness the national game between Concord and Appomattox. A large crowd of ladies and children were in atten dance, many of them from Coucord and other far off places. The game was probably the most interesting one ever played here, as the teams were evenly matched and at the end of the seventh inning the score stood 5 ,o 2 iu favor of Concord. At this stage of the game a pistol shot was heard in the middle of the crowd, which caused a stampede among the ladies and children. C. W. Harvey, of Spring Mills, shot and wounded F. L. Martin, who lives uear this place. At the time of the shootiug it was thought by many that Martin was mortally wounded, for Harvey, n less than ten feet apparently took deliberate aim at his bosum, but upon examination, his wound proved to be only a flesh wound in the left arm. Constable F. W. McKinney and other gentlemeu grabbed Har ey and placed him under arrest tud disarmed him before he could hoot again. Harvey was given a hearing before Justice Trent he waived an examination and was  laced tinder bond for his appear ance at the next term of the county court in the sum of 1000. Iu talking to the T im es  man about the affair Harvey said he was a pro fessional shot, and would not allow any man to run over him. Stated that he shot to keep Martin off of him and that Martin had struck him with brass knucks. Martin said that Harvey had assaulted him some fifteen minutes before by knocking up against him and curs iug him, blit his friends took him off and lie thought no more abou the matter until Harvey approached him in the crowd aud cursed him again, when he Martin struck him with his list and knocked him down friends took hold of Martin when llarvey got on his feet he drew his pistol and fired into the crowd There are a great many conflicting reports about the affair, no two of which seem to agree exactly, but the people who saw the affair are strong in their condemnation of a drunken man shooting into a crowd of help less women and children. It is said that both men had been drinking some and that Harvey bad assaulted several people on the grounds before he got into the troublewith Martin. Both are young men of good quali ties and while Harvey bears the eputation of being a desperate man while under the influence of liquor, he is peaceable and highly respected sober. Our town generally and especially the lovers of base call regret very much that such an affair should occur here in our usually quiet village, and it may be said that the low-abiding citizens of the commu nity will applaud the action of our public officers in their efforts at preserving the peace and bringing the guilty ones to a strict account ability in all cases like this. But for the prompt action of our officers and by standers, who disarmed Har vey many innocent people might have been killed and a general riot prccipated, as both men had many friends on the grounds."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["McKinney"], "snippet": "arm.

On Tuesday last about 12 or 1 oclock, a shooting affray occurred on the road leading to the Old Court House, between Messrs. Prank W. McKinney and Elijah Fore. The scene of the quarrel was in the neigh borhood of Galilee Church, and re sulted in McKinneys receiving a painful though not serious wound through the leg jnst above the knee. The cause of the difficulty seems to have beeu as follows Mr. Mc Kinney, as constable, was cojnmis- sioned to collect from Mr. Fore a bill due to a firm in Lynchburg. Fore refused to pay the amount declaring that the debt was unfair. McKin ney then receiving an indemnifying bond and taking, as he states, every precautionary measure to render his ictions justifiable in the eyes of the law, proceeded to levy upon Fores goods. He employed James Harvey to assist him in removing the property, On his way to Fores Store, the place of residence of Fore, he met that gentleman on his way to appomat tox Depot. Some words ensued then and Fore declared that nothing should force him to submit to being levied upon. They separated and McKinney proceeded to Fores Store and having levied upon the goods, loaded them into a wagon and set out for home. He instructed Jim Harvey not to have a word to say to Fore and to give him the road. Har vey advised McKinney that he had better be careful himseif. In the meantime Fore had reached Appomattox and found some arti cles which he had expected to ship had been attaohed and were in the possession of the law. After trans acting his business at this place, he, too, started on his return trip, Fores young son was with him, and, we think, was driving a one-horse wagon. The two parties met just below magistrate Dnrrums near Galilee Church,- and as there has been no official investigation we will give aB near as possible the state ments of both. Mr. McKinney states in brief.  saw Fore coming down the road anc. knowing that he was anxious to pick a quarrel would have done anything to have avoided i t  but as there was no way to escape meeting  him, drove on, turning out and giving hii the entire road. I had passed him and driven on about twenty yards when he turned and said Mr. McKinney you are too quick in your levies. I will teach you some sense that will benefit you in the future. I replied, Very well Mr. Fore I will be very glad to re ceive any lesson. I then started on but was again stopped and turning saw Fore shaking his fist at me while he exclaimed,  You rogue yon scoundrel, you might just as well have entered my house and stolen the goods. This was too much for human nature to submit to. I turned my jumper, rode up to him and dis mounting asked what he meant by insulting me. He was about to re peat his language when I hit him over the head with the butt end of my whip. His horse became fright ened and nearly threw Fore from the wagon. He righted himself and then I whipped him again. The horse for the second time started down the road and again nearly upset the wagon. It went about fifteen yards. I made towards Fore again. Dont you come here, he cried I still ad vanced and he cried again Dont come any nearer, dont come any nearer. I noticed that his hand was on his pistol pocket, and walking up to him I said Mr. Fore, you can shoot me if you want to, but I have whipped yon enough, and dont propose to hit you another time"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["McKinney"], "snippet": "between Messrs.
