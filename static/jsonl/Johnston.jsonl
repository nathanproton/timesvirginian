In short, the navy said, the new Pacific bases program is keep ing well apace of the general ex pansion program of the navy in building up the nations two-ocean navy to the greatest array of sea power the world has ever seen. Asserting that the base construc tion program is in many places far ahead of progress originally hoped for in their construction, the statement added that the program for construction of an air base on Midway island was completed far ahead of schedule and that con siderable expansion is under way. About 24,000,000 was involved in this single project, the statement said. The statement continued Show Real Speed. Exceptional speed was made in the development of Alaskan air bases at Sitka, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor. v The original program at Kodiak is substantially completed, although original surveys were not made un til September, 1939, and construc tion started early in 1940. The size of this base has been greatly increased and additional construction providing for enlarge ments over the initial program is proceeding satisfactorily regardless of rigorous winter conditions of the location. The additional construc tion has been planned so as not to interfere with the use of sections of the base already completed. Shows Progress. Development of the air base at Sitka is even further along than at Kodiak. Likewise, progress has been satisfactory at Unalaska. Nec essary barracks and recreational facilities for personnel have been erected and occupied. Extensive recreational facilities have been provided for men stationed in these points where the normal diversions of continental posts are lacking. Another project on which out standing progress has been made is the great drydock at Pearl Har bor. The dock is in the dry and basically complete. The great dock will take any of the navys battle ships or aircraft carriers. The Kaneohe air base on the island of Oahu is in operation and enlargements are now being car ried forward.

How difficult and Important an achieve ment this control was Is brought out by Dr. Walter Houghs study of the fire-making apparatus In the Natlon- al Mnseum, published by the Smith- sonian Institution. This Is a revision and modernization of a work first  published 40 years ago and which has long been unavailable to collector The origin of fire making, writes! Doctor Hough, need not be put very far back in time. For ages before men knew bow to make It, he contin ues, they preserved fire after lighte ning and volcano had brought It on. Illustrating the extraordinary ability developed by primitive peoples In the preservation of fire be Instances the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina who kept fire buried In the mounds, upon which the council houses were built, so that If the house were de- stroyed by enemies the fire would re- main there for a year or more. Flreless Period In History Doctor Hough questions the theory that fire Is indispensable to all hu mankind under all conditions, polnt- I Ing out that very many fire myths pos-  sessed by primitive peoples recount a stage of firelessness and a wresting of fire from those having It Doctor Hough believes that the va rious methods of producing fire by friction of wood on wood probably preceded the methods Invoking the use of minerals. He suggests a means by which man may have developed the friction method, after a long pre liminary period during which man1 gained a growing acquaintance with the properties of various substances.  . . Friction is a common experi ence and handling wood or working in wood might give to keen percep tions an odor, a vapor of smoke, sug gesting that there was fire present, . . . . which could be brought out by friction. That the primitive fire tool should take the nature of a drill is explained by the ancient character of the drill for piercing holes in all kinds of sub stances byabrasion.- In the early explorations of Amer ica, the Indian, almost without excep tion, used the friction apparatus con sisting of two sticks of wood. Primitive methods of fire mnr.g aid In determining racial relation ships. Thus about all Eskimo tribes use a four-piece fire drill, consist ing of a mouthpiece, a drill, a cord, for turning the drill, and a hearth, and other races have their own par ticular methods. The use of the mouth drill Is almost more than the white mans teeth will stand. Nature Demonstrates Way. , i In the Malay archipelago nature  seems to have shown the way to make  fire. It appears that many fires arc  started in the jungle by bamboo rub  bing together In a high windstorm  Thus the natives use two specially cut  pieces of bamboo which when sawed   one against the other produce fire. ! In view of the history of fire, its   Importance to man, its power, and   the mystery of it, there need be no 11 surprise at the existence In many ! I parts of the primitive world of fire   worship. Even In our day something 1 of this attitude toward fire can be l found among certain African tribes.   Doctor Hough quotes H. H. Johnston   to the effect that among the Wata- 1 veita fire making is the exclusive E privilege of the men, and the secret  l Is banded down from father to son.   and never under any condition re   vealed to women. A man was asked   the reason for this. Oh, said he,   If women knew how to make fire   they would become pur masters. I Among some Africans who are mas- IP ters in metal work the anomalous  l custom obtains of using wooden drills  l to light the fire which melts their I I Iron. Two pieces of pyrites or a flint and  pyrites appear to have been the first   agencies used for producing a spark L by percussion. In North America the   percussion method Is found in use   among the northerly ranging Indians   and the Eskimo of some parts.

HU death was calm and pesoefu! and he retained consciousness until a few minutes before death. HU entire family, Miss Dodge, and trained nurses were at the bedside. Dr. Hyatt said that H r. Blaines death was doe to sheer exhaustion. He was unwilling to makea statement regarding the disease of Mr. Blaine until be receiv ed the consent of the family. The news of Mr. Blaines death spread like wild-llre. Crowds gathered on the oorner and visitors flocked to the boose. Dr. Hamlin, who was pawing the boose when the announcement of death was made,at onoe entered and remained with the family for some time. Word was tnt to the President Immediately after the death. At 114 President Harrison, accompanied by Private Secretary Hal ford and Lieut. Parse, walked over to the Blaine mansion. The President showed marked signs of griei. Post master-General Waoamaker followed the footsteps of the. Prealdeut. To a reporter Dr. Johnston said I was called tbU morning to the Blaine residence about MO oclock and found him In a very exhausted condition. He baa grown weaker daring the early morning hours and about 830 oclock the nurse observed that hU breathing was more difficult and his pulse more feeble than R has been. Dr. H yatt was also sent for and arrived th-r about 10 oclock. After my arrival Mr. Blai- e cmtaued to grow weaker very rapi -ly, his pulse becoming more fer-ble. H- died a t 11 oclock. Ho was perfectly coujclou up to itbiu a fe moments of bU de tb and iveoguiz d all those around him. He died without suffer ing. Th- President had been warned of Mr Blaines approaehlng end ihm uth the pi ess bulletin wnicb iufnrmed him tuai Mr. Blaine could not live through the day. A few minutes later he receive be anuouuoemaut of his death. The Cabinet was immediately notified. Sec retary Foster, of the State Department, was at home preparing to leave town when he was notified by telephone ol Mr. Blaines death. He postponed bis trip aud ordered the Department to be dosed. The Provident issued a procla mation, announcing the death of Mr. Blaine aud directing that oo the day of the funeral all executive departments at Washington be closed that on all public buildings throughout the U utedSiatcv, the national flsg be displayed at half staffand for thirty days the Stale De partm ent be draped in mourning. At 1-J0 p. m., it was stated by friends of the family that the funeral arrange ments had been so far determined upon Set services would be held Monday forenoon and the remains would be, at least temporally, interred here In Wash ington City. Whether the funeral will be public or private, or whether the final resting place be here or at some chosen spot in Maine or elsewhere is not at this hour definitely settled. t h i cxnss or his death . In answer to a direct question. Did Blaine die of Brights disease? Dr. Johnston said While there has been during the last several months evidences of chronic of the kidneys, being a form of what is commonly known as Brights disease, yet this was not the sole cause of his death. There were other consecutive complications which tended to exhaust him and to hasten the end. Lapses which be has had from time to time were due to heart exhaustion, that is, feebleness and irregularity of the action of the heart, accompanied by difficult breath ing.Daring yesterday nothing of impor tance ooourred. Mr. Bl Ine lay there in a feeble condition, taking but very litue nourishment. Indeed, he has taken but very little nourishment since his serious attack of December 18th, and this has oonsiste 1 aim st whollv of milk. At no time has he had any difficulty with his stomafth, and he has been able to digest whatever food was given him. Tnrough ut his long illness he has been able to reoognizs members of hi family and his physicians. Wnile he ha not conversed to any extent, even with his family, for some time ptst, he has always been able to indioate bis want very clearly. To questions whioh have been asked him - he has always replied intelligently, but in monosyllables. Mr. J bnsou further said that there hid been really no hope of Mr. Blaines utiim ite reoovery slime that Sunday in December, hot up to within the last two v or three w-eks strong hope had been entertained that his life might be pro longed. Since that time, however, there has been no hope. No effort has been made to sustain life by the use of atlm- utants, and praotioally nothing has been done except to give him nourishment.
