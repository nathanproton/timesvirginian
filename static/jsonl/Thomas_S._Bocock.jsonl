He was educated by private tutors and then graduated from Hampden- Sydney College in 1838. He was admitted to The Bar in 1840 and was a member of the House of Delegates of Virginia, 1842-44. He was prosecuting attorney for Appomattox County, 1845- 46 and was elected as U . S. Congressman and served from March 4, 1847 until March 8, 1861. A t that time he was fleeted to the Congress of the Confederate States of America and was chosen as Speaker of that body February 18,1862. After the War Between the States, he returned to Appo mattox and served in the State Legislature aa Delegate for the terms of 1869, 1870, 1877 and 1878. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conven tion in New York City in 1868, at St. Louis in 1876 and at pi wh rm ati in 1880 .

It was given I me by a friend, who husband has a I brother living in Appomattox. They had written him sometime back and  asked him if he knew Judge Joel W.  Flood, who is a family connection of I mine. So he had sent them this clip ping from the paper of February I 25th. entitled, Father Darkleaf by c. h. r. I enjoyed it so very much, and thought I would write you and see if you might have some information from the early editions of your pa per, which might be of interest to me about the members of my fam ily who lived in Appomattox in the early days. My ancestors who lived there were Samuel Bocock, the home place was called, Wildway, which was half way between Bent Creek and Vera, Virginia, from material I have that my uncle, the late Charles Henry Buchanan, had sent my mother. He said that in 1934 it was owned by J. S. Kinney, Rt. 3, Appomattox, Va. Then I wondered if there was a Thomas family who lived there in those early days, whose daughter, Judith married Capt. John Bocock. This must have been around 17 hun dred and something. I cant put my hands on my data which has the dates on it, right now, anyway, the son of the above, John Thomas Bo cock married Mary Flood, and I be lieve the Flood family lived there also. One of the Floods married a Mary Fuqua, it was either John or Thomas. I have information which says one and then the other. I am most anxious to locate information on the Fuqua family, and to straight en out about which one of the Flood family is my ancestor. Judge Flood wrote me that it was John Flood II, and I feel sure he is correct. John Thomas Bocock and Mary Flood Bocock were the parents of my grandmother Mary Flood Bocock who married January 1, 1854 in Ap pomattox Appomattox Court House Virginia, John Rice Buchanan of Rockbridge County, Virginia. My mother, Mary Flood Buchanan was their daughter. I shall appreciate it very much if you could send me some material on these ancestors of mine. I know a great deal about the Bocock line, but you might have some material I do not have. If you do not have any records about them in your early file, you might be able to give me the name and address of some one who may be able to give me some. f Most sincerely, Frances Hall McCracken, note We will be glad to give the ftwuiwa y i iUvurttwKSii  any of our readers who may wish to write her regarding the above."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Thomas", "Bocock", "Bocock"], "snippet": "he is correct.
