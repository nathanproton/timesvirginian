As a paste mixed together, three parts, baking soda and orte part water. 2. In \u00e0 solution dissolve 4 tablespoons baking soda in 1 quart water. 3. As a dry product, sprinkle baking soda stra ight from the box. Baking soda can help solve many household - problems. Some of them are as follows H If anything can ruin the taste of ice cream, it is stale freezer air. Even ice cubes pick up odors and flavors from this culprit and spoil the9taste of beverages. Protect the food in your freezer by using a one pound box of baking soda to absorb freezer smells. For best results,, change the box every other month, and recycle the used baking soda., by pouring it down tnb drain or garbage disposal to clean and deodorize. 2. What would you do if a fat fire started in your frying pan? Would you panic or would you remember that baking soda can come to the rescue? Baking soda can extinguish small grease, oil and electrical fires. When heated it produces carbon .dioxide that smothers the flames. First turn off beat, then stand back nd toss generous handfulls of dry baking soda at the base of the flames. Do not use this to put out flames in deep fat, however, as this could spatter the grease and pread the fir.  3. As a safety precaution, always have an emergency fire pail ne\u00e2r the kitchen range, garbage or wherever a grease or electrical fire . may occur. To make the fire pail, just pour the contents of a one pound box of baking soda into an empty one popnd coffee can. Then wrap a bright redfire label around thp can. Include on this labdl. telephone numbers of th\u00e9 fire department and rescue Squad and simple instructions for putting out a fire. 4. Simple beauty prepara tions are often as effective as high price cosmetics. As \u00e0 facial scrub to deep clean pores and loosen blackheads, baking soda is suitable for women and men. Teenagers wilt find it especially helpful for problem skin. Wash your fa throroughly. Then Combine equal parts of baking soda and water in the palm of your hand.

Anyone interested in donating to the fund is asked to contact Mrs. T. L. Stratton or any member of the chapter to make a contribution. The library pro vides an invaluable service to our community.
