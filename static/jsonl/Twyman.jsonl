It appears that Tucker was slain on the back porch of the residence in Evergreen in which he and his wife, her mother, and her brother, May berry lived. This shooting apparently occurred sometime after 10 oclock Friday night. Called to the scene from his home in Appomattox, Dr. Christian was on an errand of mercy. From a re construction of the events, it appears that the popular young doctor was shot as he approached the door of the -house. Christians body was found on the walk to the house, and removed only after a terriffic gun battle between the posse and Mayberry. Nearly two hours passed between the shooting of Tucker and the flni arrest, of May- berry- Mayberry was Yelled by a shotgun blast near a garage hide out from which he had fired from 30 to 50 shots from a pistol and a shotgun at the surrounding officers. Mayberry was given medical treat ment here and sent to Rlctnond Saturday morning. His wounds are said not to be serious. The midnight sounding of sirens and the use oi flares to light up the scene attracted the attention of a sizeable gathering of spectators and details of the tragedy have been the topic of interest here since. Funeral services for the victims were held Monday. Serviced for Mr. Tucker were conducted from the Evergreen Baptist Chunch, by the pastor, the Rev. D. L. Bailey. Mili tary services were conducted by the grave by American Legion Post 104. Burial was in the Evergreen Ceme tery. Funeral services for Dr.Christlan were held here Monday at 11 A. M., from Appomattox Court House Pres byterian Church, conducted by his pastor, Dr. Twyman Williams, as sisted by Dr. C. A. Collins, Jr., and the Rev. B. T. Price. A great concourse of friends gath ered for the services. An outpour ing of floral tributes and messages of condolence bore testimony to the esteem in which th1 young physician and his family are held. Son of Dr. D. A. Christian, Jr. the physician began his practice here following service in the Navy during World War II. He occupied the office his father had used for a generation of service to the people of this area. Affectionay known as Young Doctor David, he endeared himself to the public by his skill as a physician and the charm of his personality. He was serving as a member of the Appo mattox Town Council and recently organized a group here to further the cause of physical education at the Appomattox school. As a mark of respect, local busi ness places closed during the funeral hour. A movement has begun to have an appropriate memorial in his hon or. A meeting of friends was held this week to organize a memorial movement, and another meeting will be held Monday night.

It is alleged that such proceedings as were carried on four years ago were very distasteful to many of the citizens of the county and for that reason the rank and file of voters are slow to express their choice for fear of the recurrence of hostile feeling. While no doubt man j have de cided views a to whom they will vote for, but little or no pub lic demonstrations have taken place throughout the county and while a few public gatherings have been held, the attendance at these meetings have been small and little interest in such meetings have been manifested.

Colonel Terrell being a candidate for what is called the organizations forces and Mr, Gannaway representing t h e antis. In this, like other county contests, there has been no issue and the fight hangs chiefly on personalities. In some quarters, the question of the short ballot issue has been in jected in which Mr. Gannaway ias declared himself as opposed to the short ballot, while no such statement has come from Mr. Terrell other than he is for the administration policies. As the short ballot, is an administra tion policy, however, it is regard ed that Mr. Terrell is for it, and su far, that is about the main is sue involved between the two candidates for that office.
