The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co.

Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight.

On Deo. 51st., on the Lynchburg and Durham railroad, about six miles from Lynqhburg, a terrible crime was committed. Some- three weeks prior to the tragedy, the young and attractive daughter of Mr. J. H. White, of Lynchburg, was married to Pleasant Hendricks, of Campbell co.unty. They made their home near Bocock Station shortly afterward, and livedhappily together. On the night of Dep. 21st. between 9 and 10 oclook, Mrs. Hendricks was sitting in her room reading The Chil dren of the Abbeyand Mr.Hendrioks was asleep. There was bnt little flip on the hearth. The door was bolted with an ordinary lock bolt. All at once it was broken down and four masked men rushed into the room. One of them held an axe in bis hand, and rushing to the bed struck Hendricks on the head with the sharp edge. Mrs. Hendricks, over come by the right fainted, and when she became conscious was lying on a hastily improvised- pallet out in the yard, where she supposed she had been taken by the murderers. Thie house was enveloped iiyflames. Many of the neighbors were attracted by the light, but arrived too late to ex tinguish the Are or to rescue the body. er trunk had also been refnpved and was placed so near the burning building that it caught on fire and was entirely consumed. While the crowd stood about the burning house it was whispered around that four negroes from Jaok- son Town, a small suburb of Lynofar burg, bad been seen hunting in the neighborhood. Suspicion being arous ed, parties were immediately dis- latohed to arrest them. A ndthis was accomplished before morningi hree of the negroes were arrested by officers, and the fourth one sur rendered himself. In the meantime, when the flames died down, a search wB instituted tot the murdered man, and after a long hunt they found what was left of the body. The heart, lungs and a few fragments of bones were all that remained of what a few hours before bad been a prosperous,happy human beidg. Mr. Hendricks was an industrious and well-to-do farmer of about forty-five years of age, ahd was not known to have bad an enemy. On the day before, however, be had brought home 200, He had given bis wife 15 and placing the remain der in an oil cloth sack had con cealed it in the bed.. It is thought, that, as Mr. Hendricks had been hauling posts to Jackson Town while he had this money in his pos session, the negroes must have dis covered the fact and planned the robbery. On Dec. 23rd an inquisition was held at the scene of the crime, anc. was adjoqrned to the 27th to the Law Building at Lynchburg. Mr. W. M. Murrell, assisted by Mr. Thos. Whitehead, Jr., conducted the exam ination for tbe commonwealth, while the prisoners were represented by Maj. T. J. Kirkpatrick, Judge H. M. Ford and Mr. James W. Wright. The only witness called was Mrs. Hendricks. She identified the fonr negroes as the persons who entered her house, bnt her testimony die i not 6onvince the coroners jury for they were divided in their opinions as to the guilt of the men arrested who were Commodore Johnson, Rob ert Smith, William Coghill and William Fields. The coroner, Mr. John W. Gills, and three of the jnrors declared the deed to have been perpetrated by tbe prisoners, while the remaining three decided that the fatal blow had been struck by parties unknown. The  murder continues to be the all-absorbing topic of conversation among the county people. Many now believe that the four negroes are the guilty parties, while many others do not think that the right men have been captured and, from the latest reports, we learn that considerable indignation is expressed at the unnecessary detention of the prisoners. ________________ Toga Notes.
