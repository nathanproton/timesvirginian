Three requests for new addit ions were made from residents of Cloverhill district for a total length of 1.45 miles. Stonewall district also had three requests for additions for a total of 1.25 miles and Southside district, two requests for a total of .85 miles. Six requests for road im provements for a total length of eight miles came from Clo verhill district four requests from Stonewall for a total of 6.30 miles and four requests from Southside district for a total of 5.50 miles. In other action Friday super visors head from about 30 tax payers in person and 1,000 pet ition with regard to the recent reassessment of property. One individual, speaking dir ectly to the board, is concerned about an increase of 65 in his assessment and feels that his is unequal taxation in relation to property adjacent or close to his own in Pamplin. Walter Henry, farmer of Stonewall district, says he is concerned with land-use, and that farmers taxe s are out of proportion sometimes to tax as sessments for land which is going to be used for develop ment, other than farming. Supervisors also approved an ordinance which dissolves the former Finance Board of the county and transfers those dut ies to the board of supervisors. Supervisors devoted a good deal of time to the entire ques tion of taxation. The rate for taxation is set each April and the board talked about possibi lities of tax revenue from a bumper strip on each automo bile, a tax on public utilities or extra sales tax. Board mem bers stated that their effort in this line are directed to  spreading taxes among all the people - those who own pro perty and those who do not so that the burden of county gov ernment and schooling can be shared by all who benefit. Earlier inthemeetingattorn- ey Robert Carter said he spoke for the delegation present in the Court House asking for clari- ficiation of the recent reas sessment. He asked tha t the tax be lowered from the present 3.00 per hundred evaluation.
