R. Horsley published in another column in reference to a good roads maes meeting here next court day. Our roads are indeed in a deplorable condition and some system must be devised to improve them. We are inclined to favor the old system. It is true the court of Appeals in the Proflit case which went up from Louisa county, held in effect, that to require a citizen to work on the road was the imposition of a poll tax on said citizen and as the constitution only authorized, a poll-tax of one and a half dollars, all laws enacting the labor system were unconstitutional. We have never seen the full text of this de oision, but we are constrained to the belief that there is something in the Louisu law, peculiar to itself to justify such a finding by our appellate court. We know that such was the opiuion of our A tty for the Commonwealth nearly a year ugo and that at that time he filed an opinion with Judge Chris tian bolding this view and advising the court to enforce the old sys tem. At any rate the effort to enforce thiB system should be tried now and if there is complaint let a case be made up and taken to the new court of Appeals. This court has just reversed the decision of the old court in the ceV ebrated Mary Miller case. This de cision was rendered by the old court iu January 1892 and since that tim has cost the people of this State more than a quarter of a million of dollars. By the Mary Miller decis ion the old court took from Justices of the Peace, almost all of their criminal jurisdiction and forced the county courts to try even the most trivial ctises. By their reversal of this decision the new Democcratic court restored to the J. Ps. their jurisdiction, which will save to the taxpayers large sums of money annu ally. We believe if the road question was taken to the new court, the Proffit case would meet with the same fate as the Mary Milier case"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["J", "R", "Horsley"], "snippet": "the letter of Mr. <mark>J</mark>. <mark>R</mark>. <mark>Horsley</mark> published in another column"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["J", "R", "Horsley"], "snippet": "the letter of Mr. <mark>J</mark>. <mark>R</mark>. <mark>Horsley</mark> published in another column"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The Richmond Dispatch publish es the following extract from a let ter from its Apponiatiox correspond ent, of dale September 7th 1 saw iu your correspondence from Pamplius yesterday a statement that C. H. Chiiti n, of this county, is the Tyler Democratic candidate tor the legislature to represent this county and Campbell i had for merly seen a stateuieut in your paper in a letter from Concord to the ef fect that Mr. Chilton was uomiua- t d at a muss-meetiug held at Con- coid, at which 362 voters were pres ent in person or by proxy. 1 have intended for some time to correct the statement contained iu the Concord letter, but not having been present at that meeting, 1 had to wait until J could get my facts accurately, which I give you as fol lows  The meeting was called by people who have for years antagonized the Democratic party. All persons, ir respective of political parties, who favored Governor Tylers election to the United Stater Senate were invi ted to participate in it. It was not a meeting iu the form of a conven tion or one iu u inch the people ton Id be represented by delegates, bufc-was called as a muss meeting. There .ere presett by actual count twenty-nine voters,, twenty-three of whom were from Appomattox and six from Campbell. Turn not post ed as toChe politics of all the Camp bell participants, but I am very fa miliar with the politics of those who attended the meeting from Appo mattox. Only one of themviz., Mr. L. A- Williams, a brother-in-law of Mr. C. H. Chiltonshas been considered a Democrat for the past four years. Some of the most prom inent figures in it were W. C. Frank lin, county chairman of the Repub lican party of Appomattox, who has time and again been the Republican candidate for various offices H. E. Gilliam, a leading Republican F. B. .ones, T. H. A. Cheatham, C. B. Blox ton, and Hut Ferguson colored other prominent Republicans. In justice to Hut, it should be stated that when the resolution was passed by themeeting declaring that no money should be used in the interest of tne nominee, he left in disgust. The meeting in no sense repre sents any DemocVatic sentiment iu Appomattox county. There hasj bean no split in the Democratic par ty here, and 1 do not believe there has been or will be any in Campbell, but I know the Democrats of our county are solid for the regular nom ine, Mr. J. R. Horsley. We think it an injustice not only to our nominee but to our people to characterize a meeting gotten up and dominated by leading Republi- eani as a Democratic meeting, when the other man they nominated if, by any mishap, he should be elected, would not be admitted into a Dem ocratic CUUCU8, Mr. Chilton himself has not voted the Democratic ticket for at least four years, and probably longer. M r. J. R. Horsley was nominated by a Democratic mass-meeting which was the largest meetiug of the kind held in this county in the recollect ion of its oldest inhabitants. It. was fully representative of the wishes of the party. It was held after due uotice and after an active cau vass of the county by Mr, Horsleys fiiends and the friends of I is opponent,"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["J", "R", "Horsley"], "snippet": "regular nom ine, Mr. <mark>J</mark>. <mark>R</mark>. <mark>Horsley</mark>.

Now, Therefore, Be It Re solved That we commend the fair and forceful campaign our governor is making, for which too much praise and commenda tion cannot be given.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.
