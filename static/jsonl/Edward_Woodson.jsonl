The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

She was two years old at the time of the Surrender in 1865. She is reanarkedly active and mentally alert, and relates in teresting incidents of her childhood and at the same time makes com parisons of Then and Now. In her own words, she tells this story When I was a baby, lying on the floor on a pillow, four Yankee sol diers came by our home. One of them asked my mother how old I was and she told them. Then he ask ed my name and my mother proud ly told him, Emma Lee, named for the General. The soldier c-ursed-and said they killed all babies named after Lee. At that time my Aunt Lou rushed in from the kitchen and said my name was Emma Leeola, which quick thinking on her part saved my life. Mrs. Woodson proudly tells that her late father, First Sgt. Jones, was ordered by General Robert E. Lee to stand up on the buggy and call out and tell the soldiers I have surrendered. She said My father was an un dertaker. While he was delivering a coffin one afternoon, a customer came in and wanted a coffin. I ask ed if he brought the measurements with him and he said he did. I cut the lumber by the measurements, made the coffin and Stained it, made the delivery and collected the 3.00 before my father returned. Mrs. Woodson recalls traveling from Prince Edward County to Ap pomattox in a wagon with her fam ily to witness the Dedication of the New Court House here. She is the mother of three chil dren and one adopted son. Now liv ing is her son in Florida and her adopted son, Leroy Woodson, of Bal timore. Md.

A joint convention of the Peoples party of Appomattox and Campbell counties met in Evans Hall, this place, at noon last Friday to nominate a floater to the legislature, from the above named counties. Chas. T. Moses, of Appomattox,, was chosen chairman, and Dr. T. W. Evans, of Campbell, secretary of the conven tion. Wm. A. Thornhill, of Appo mattox, was nominated by acclama tion- as the floater candidate. There were about thirty delegates in attendance and considerable enthus iasm prevailed in their ranks. Ed ward Moormaw, Dr. T. W. Evans, C. B. Bloxton, Jas. P. Fleshman and others responded to calls for speeches. Each speaker seemed to he quite sanguine of the success of their ticket, and well pleased with the general outlook for their party in the State. A very ludicrous, if not significant, incident occurred while the conven tion was in session. A large flock of scavenger birds, commonly known as tnrkey buzzards, after hovering for a while over the Convention Hall took flight in direction of Charlotte county. It was a custom amongst the ancient augurs to predict success or failure of any enterprise from the flight of birds and it may be that onr Third party brethem can gather some consolation from this question able omen. However, a local wit comments on the incident in this manner These birds were in hot pursuit of the defunct remains of the Third party, and after locating it in the Convention Hall, immedi ately took flignt to Charlotte, where it had been previously announced, that there would be a similar gather ing of the same party on Monday. Rev. J. W. Hilldrup has been con ducting protracted services at Salem church, during the past week. Seven persons united themselves with Bethlehem church at this place on last Sabbath, as a result of a series of meetings held with the above-men tioned church, and conducted by Rev.

Jones, commanding Com pany E , of the Seventy-first Regiment, prominent-in politics and business cir cles in Norfolk,-killed Maude Cameron, and then slashed his own throat at the the womans house. She went to Nor folk about a year ago, after graduation from a convent in Carolina. She met Jones, who became infatuated with her, and she returned his affection. Each, it is said, were intensely jealous of the other, and this jealousy caused the trag edy. Mr. John Johnson, an aged and re spected farmer of the Fork district, Warren county, was attacked on Main street, near Johnson Bros. confectionery store, by Janies E. Conner and cut in the neck, cheek and stomach, making three very serious wounds. Mr. John son was also hit across the head-by Ben jamin Sonner with a heavy club, which rendered his unconscious for a long time. There seems to have been a long-stand ing grudge between Johnson and Son ner. Johnson is being attended by Dr. M. L. Garrison. Both James E. Sonner and his son Benjamin were arrested. Mr. Johnsons condition is serious. Dorsey Mills, a young white man, aged about 23 , had his left foot crushed between the bumpers of two freight cars of a Southern Railway freight at Front Royal. Mills, it seems, attempted to cross the bumper, when the train gave a sudden lurch and caught his foot. Dr. Kipps was immediately upon the scene to render medical assistance. Amputa tion may be necessary. The cutting of the channel of the Ap pomattox River from Petersburg to James River, at City Point, to a depth of 12 feet and width of 40 feet, was completed Friday. The work was done by the United States Government, at a cost of  10 , 000 . The government will begin work immediately on the diversion of the Appomattox River, the cost of which will be  150 , 000 , to be paid for by the government. One man was killed and five others hurt by the bursting of a 28 -foot fly wheel in the bar mill of the Tredegar Iron Works, Richmond. The shed in which it was situated was wrecked, and the wheel, broken into several large pieces, flew in every direction, parts of it landing over on Gambles Hill Park, across the canal. The Old Virginia Copper Company, owned by Pittsburg and Indiana capi talists, has just been organized in Lu- ray. The company is to develop the mineral lands near Stony Man Camp, seven miles east of Luray. The home office is to be in Fort Wayne, Ind. The copper deposits at this place are said to be among the richest in the State. The police of Winchester are scouring the city and surrounding country for a young white man, supposed to be J. C. Rainey, of Jefferson county, West Vir ginia, who went by the name of M. C. Morgan, who is wanted for passing al leged worthless checks on Winchester merchants. The Henrico County Jail, built a few years ago, is about to collapse. Big cracks have occurred in the walls on account of the ground sinking. No pris oners are being kept in that part of the building because of the danger. A big sewer running under the jail is the probable cause of the trouble. In Lynchburg owners of all places of public resort, factories and boarding houses three stories or more in height have been notified that they must com ply with a new city ordinance which re quires the erection of iron fire-escapes. Mr. Gus Rock, a prominent farmer and citizen of Farnaham, was run over by a two-horse wagon loaded with to matoes. The wheel passed over his body, inflicting injuries from which he died. Thomas Parsons, colored, shot and killed Thomas Banks, another negro, at Rideway Church, in Buckingham, during a protracted meeting. Parsons claims self-defense, saying Banks hit him with his fist. Banks .is a bad name among the negroes of Buckingham, two of the name having committed atrocious mur ders recently. The annual convention of the Womans Christian Temperance Union of Win chester and Frederick county was held at Winchester in the Market Street Methodist Episcopal Church. Mrs. Amy Weech, State superintendent of evan gelistic work, responded to the address of welcome of Mrs. Arthur Leaf. Miss Lona A.

Buchanan, of Brucetown, re cording secretary, and Mrs. John Locke, of Stephen City, treasurer. Miss Lucy Anderton, of Tappahan- nock, on the Rappahannock River, and her guests had a narrow escape from drowning while sailing. In the boat were Miss Dorothy Hope and Mr. May, of Baltimore, and Mr. Henry Temple. The boat capsized in the channel and the occupants clung to it until rescued after a terrible experience by two negroes. Genevie Scott, the little son of Robert Scott, of Pocahontas, a suburb of Peters burg, attempted to jump on a freight train on the Norfolk and Western Rail road while passing through Blandford. He fell and had his right leg and arm so badly crushed that he died at the Home for the Sick. H. J. Fraley, a well-known citizen of Rappahannock county, is dead at his home near Sperryville, 14 miles east of Luray. His death was due to typhoid fever. Several other members of his family have the fever. Gideon Hoake, one of the oldest citi zens of Page county, died at his home near Ida, eight miles south of Luray. He was about 85 years of age and is survived by seven children. Mr. John H. Harrison, of Petersburg, and Mrs. Sallie Cordle, of Brunswick county, his sister, met in Petersburg for the first time in 20 years. Mrs. Cordle has been the mother of 10 children and the grandmother of 64 grandchildren. Nine of the former and 40 of the latter are now living, and she has three great grandchildren alive. Judge John D. Horsley fell down the steps at the Academy of Music, Lynch burg, in trying to save an old gentleman who had fallen. The Judge fractured his cheekbone. The incident probably will cause him to postpone a trip to Europe, which he was about to begin. I Magistrate Angle, of Henrico county, passed the death sentence on a dog train ed by three negro boys to steal .chickens and bring them to his masters. Many depredations have occurred by the use of this dog. The three negroesPercy Bundy, Charles Woodson and Benja min Joneswere sentenced for chicken I stealing.
