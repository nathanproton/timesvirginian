After a delightful halftime showing by Nelsons Homecom ing activities, it was time once again for football. And football it was When with 637 left in the third quarter, Trent broke through the middle and galloped 67 long yards to set the Raider fans wild! Coleman again split the uprights for the P.A.T. The Raiders were now out front 14-0. It was not long after that when Trent, on the same play, carried the ball 55 yards to score his third TD for the game. Tommy Bryant, the kicker for the Raiders, put his foot into one and backed the Governors receiving team into the end zone. Bryant has done a tremendous job this season for the Raiders.

Curtain was written in the miH 1940s and was intended to be published after her death, but for some reason, she changed her mind and released it for publication this year. This is one of her better books and will probably be classed with such Christie classics as The Murder of Roger Ackroyd The A.B.C. Murders and Ten Little Indians.

The death car plunged over the left side of Route 26, dopvn an em bankment and literally wrapped it self around a tree. The ear jack knifed, badly mangling the victims. After the car was prized from the tree, and brought to Appomattox Sunday morning, large crowds gath ered all during the day to view the wreckage. Other crowds drove to the wreck site on Route 26. State Police who investigated the crash, declared that high speed was the obvious cause of the wreck.
