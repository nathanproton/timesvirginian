The act creating the Commission for Revision of the Code of Virginia was approved on March 21, 1914, and is listed in chapter 193, section 1, Acts of Assembly. Section 1, provides that the Gov ernor shall, from a list of ten qualified citizens of Virginia, who shall be nom inated by the Supreme Court of Ap peals of Virginia, appoint three, com missioners to revise, codify and index, with suitable marginal citations .and references, the.general statute law of this State, whose duty it shall be to collate, revise and codify all the gen eral statutes, civil and criminal, of this Commonwealth, which may be in force at the time of the completion of their work and properly index the same. They shall denote all Imperfections, contradictions and omissions, and recommend to the General Assembly how they may be reconciled, supplied or amended without producing a radi cal chnge In the present statute law. of the State. It will be their duty also, to make such marginal citations as will be helpful to a clear understanding of the statutes, and they must supervise the publication of thq first edition of the revision and codification. Each of i the commissioners shall receive th\u00e9 -snm of 6,090, and shall have power to appoint a clerk, whose salary shell not exceed 1,800 a year, and to em ploy such additional clerical help as may be necessary, at a total expense not to exc\u00e9ed 3,000 per. annum. The commission is required to make iis re port to the General Assembly on the first day of the session in 1916. It is believed that the commissioners will begin its labors In the very near future, having before it an elaborate and intricate task. The sum of 40,000, or so much ther- of as may he necessary, was appro priated for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the act, including the publication, of the new Code, Prdfessor Burks is Son of Former Reviser. The Cqde of Virginia was last of ficially revised in 1887. Professor Burks, who is a son of Judge Edward C. Burks, who was at that time one of the revisers. The other two were Judge Waller R. Staples and Judge Riely, both of whom afterwards served on the bench of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, The appoint ment is considered a high honor by the legal profession, scarcely second to a designation on the Supreme bench. It i\u00ea an open secret that at the session of the General Assembly of 1908 a bill  was offered providing for a Code revision commission, and that it had sufficient votes pledged to secure its passage. A campaign was launched to secure positions as revisers for per tain Virginia lawyers. The patrons f the bill, realizing the Immense impor tance of the work to the State, and fearing political interference, pre ferred to see the bill pigeonholed rath er than take the chance of having any but the. best men in the State named as revisers. At the last session, com mittees of the House and Senate con sulted as to the best methods of safe guarding the appointments, finally de termining on the course provided in the bill of having the Supreme Court nominate ten, from whom the Gov ernor selected three. May Secure Expert To Make Index. The act provides for the employment of a clerk, who, it is believed, should be a trained law student. Later it is believed the commission will need the services of an expert cataloguer from some big library, as it is realized that the index to the Code is in many re spects its most important feature. For some years past the Code in practical use in Virginia has been the compilation made by AttorUey-Gederal John Garland Pollard in 1904, and which was published by a lawbook firm. Since the State has Issued an official Code, the Constitution has been rewritten, and the statute law of the State has undergone extensive changes in almost every section."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Commonwealths", "attorney"], "snippet": "1891 he was elected <mark>Commonwealths</mark> <mark>attorney</mark> of Wash ington County,"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Commonwealths", "attorney"], "snippet": "1891 he was elected <mark>Commonwealths</mark> <mark>attorney</mark> of Wash ington County,"}], "text_match": 1733921019837546617, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "2216192835584", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 1, "score": "1733921019837546617", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
