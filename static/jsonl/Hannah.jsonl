They were in formed with an indifferent smile, that they had other important du ties and home affairs claiming their time, and their quarters could be better spent elsewhere than on the dead. In one seuse this is true. We have home duties and try not to neglect them, aud the monev ould be possibly more wisely spent While we do this to honor our dead, we try also to impress npo. the minds of the children of the county, hat the Confederate cause was just .ml right and thatthir fathers were not rebellious traitors and to give them a desire to acquire knowledge of the events of their country, and to teach, them to be patriotic aud proud of their South-land and an cestors. The little knowledge, be ginning here may grow in the minds and hearts of each, and be of great benefit to all. The president of the U. D. C. thought last year of giviug up the charter of the Appo mattox Chapter U. D. C. on account of the ladies lack of interest in this county. She wrote the National l D. C. president, and the Virginia president U. D. C. to that effect, stating she would join a chapter in Lynchburg. Letters from the Va. division, S. C. division and Md. di vision came pouring in not to let Appomattox surrender the second time also sending a list of names of prominent ladies who would join among them, Miss Ruth Early, Mrs. James Garnett, Miss M. Amelia Smith, the piesideut of Va. division U. D. C. and the daughter of ex-Gov Wm. Smith of Va., known as Ex tra Billy. The letter expressed surprise at the Appomattox ladies not caring to join one of the largest organizations m the whole south and living in one of the most his torical counties in the world. It is quite a reflection upon the county. We revised the roll and now have ouly eighteen members lu t they say they intend to keep up the or ganization and to be proud they are U. O C. of Appomattox and we shall be more than pleased if Coal ing will forward us the names ot the ladies desiring to join the IT, D.

W. Hunter, president of U. D. C. West Appomattox. One prominent aim of the U. D. C. is to gather histori cal facts to help the historians of the U. D. 0. historical committee in collecting war experiences, inci dents and reminiscences of the old soldiers, their wives, daughters or any one who can remember during the Civil war. The U. D. C. es pecially requests, Mrs. T. W. Johns to write up hers and Capt. Johns also Mrs. George Miles, Mrs. A. H. Bocock, Major Flood, Mr. Chap Chilton, Drs. Wm. White and Wm. H.

One such place is the home of Mr. George H. Shreve and the late Ellie Shreve, of Route 1, Appomattox, located approxi mately 6 miles from Evergreen, The home of Mr. Shreve was built in 1820 and was known as the Captain William Han nahs Plantation. Although it originally contained over 1,000 acres, the land has been sold off until only 303 acres remain. The frame constructed house, painted white with black shutters, is located on a knoll under m ajestic oak trees. English ivy grows in profusion around the base of the trees and native holly trees add their beauty to the lawn and nearby fields. The high ceilings and spacious rooms are a perfect setting for the beautiful antiques which furnish the house. Among the unusual pieces is a table which belonged t 6 the 4 fstftiliy of Patrick Henry. This piece, according to Mr. Shreve, will be left to the Patrick Henry Foundation. The wide polished boards of the entrance hall are the very same ones put there in 1820. In the basement, or cellar as it was known in those days, is a small room within a room, known as the wine cellar. Inside are the racks where the homemade wine was stored arql aged.

Such younjg men need to be informed. The man who succeeds to-day ia business, scholar ship j or politics succeeds because he knows how, and he knows how because he has learned how. He who doe 3 not know how is foreordained to failure. There is no more important question the young man can ask himself than how ho can prepare for life as not to be a castaway not lost in the next world, but shipwrecked in ths. For the ratio between what a nan is and what he can do i 3 a constant ratio. Every man will have all the power he earns, and the power that he has will tell, not because people like it or like him, but because it is power, and as such can keep itself erect without being propped up by a labor union cr heid in its place because it is somebodys son. It follows, then, that the most import ant thing a boy can do is to get ready. It is inspiration to kno.v that every ounce of encr-y put into work in the cariy years is so much distinct guarantee of usefulness in the adult years. And next to getting ready, the father should tell his boy that he must get ready for rough weather. The bey must learn to handle the boat of his own experience if he is not to be driven upon the shallows or into the breakers. As he meets and masters the difficulties that beset him getting out of the harbor of the high school or the college, he is equipping himself for the enemies that will assail him on the high sCas. John, then, here points out the possible ways of getting ready. He asserts that permanent success does not depend upon mood, will of the flesh, or will of man, Let me translate Family, force, fur-  but solely upon God. this into the four Fs nishings, faith. John says first a mans success does not I depend upon his family. Dr. Lyman Ab-  bott has developed this thought rational- l ly That no people are great or good sim- i ply because of their ancestry. The great- I ness of America does not depend primari-  ly upon its Pilgrim history. NTo one would j for a .moment dispute this with him. But j I desire to emphasize this from the domes tic viewpoint. A m  s spiritual success, says John, does not upend upon his fam ily. Then it makes no difference what the family, the Bible lays no stress upon here-  dity. He who says this does not know the  Bible. The Bible lays great stress upon I heredity.. When it writes the life of a I great man it begins with his parents. The foundations of cue generation are in all respects laid in the antecedent generation. In an important sense the boy begins to live when his father begins to live. The child is the parent continued down into a new generation. This is science, and it is I good science. But this is Scripture, and it  is good Scripture. Scripture emphasized heredity long before science was born. Hannah, the mother of Moses Elizabeth, I Mary, Lois and Eunice are all maguificent 1 monuments. The Christian women who would duplicate these glorious sons must first duplicate their matchless mothers. As believers in the Bible we have an in terest in heredity. It is the Gospel expec tation that the children grow up bearing the physical features of tneir parents, so in time they will come to embrace and ex- 1 emplify tbe parents faith. Thats what Timothy did, in whom the great apostle rejoiced so much. Heredity is mighty, but let us not think it is almighty. Heredity gives us tendency, but it gives us noth ing else. The children of good parents take in goodness more easily than the chil dren of bad parents. The children of edu cated parents acquire ideas more easily than those of ignorant parents. The fath er, who for five and twenty years has been saying Two times two are four, I guess Ill make it five, gives to his baby child the tendency to make the same multipli cation, but the child must make the choice before it becomes to him a sin. How I wish that that great sermon of Henry Ward Beeecher on Heredity Influence could be printed as a supplement to our courses  in ethics. That sermon makes men tremble at what they may bequeath to their children. But after all, the grace of God is stronger than the sin -of man. What a man is he chooses to be. Weak ness, tendency are handed down, hut the choice is made by the individual himself. Your spiritual success, young man, does not depend upon your ancestry, your her edity, your fathers habits, or your family. John says no man is safe simply because .of his family. But it does not depend upon your per sonal force, which is a free translation for the New Testament word flesh. It stands for the animal man, not necessarily the bad animal man. It means a strong, vigorous force in the man himself. Now, John says this strong, vigorous force will never give a man his spiritual supremacy. Let me illustrate, rather than debate, the proposition. Noah must have had a strong and vigorous will, but it did not insure him against drunkenness. Samson had a ---------- - . mighty will, but it was no match for the 60 kind as to pray him I dark eyes of Delilah. David, what a clor- 001 and then tako it I ions career in overcoming obstacles! What i way vigor! What power! But in the presence  of his guilty love he was weak and wretched. The Rev. Arthur Diinmerdale, I in that greatest American novel, The I Scarlet Letter, had a mightv will, but he j was lost in the presence of Hester Prynne.  That great Irishman, greater than any I other, who ruled with a rod of iron who 1 took the miserabiy misunderstood prob- I lem of home rule and lifted it into a cen- I tral place in the worlds thought who  thrashed the London Times who wrought I miracles in the House of Commons, and j who lifted William E.

Tney were Just emerg ing from the ancient darkness into the later day. God had assigned them leaders whose work it was to lead them into the truth, but they werh slow to follow. Being nomads they appointed wor ship wherever they were. There was no temple, tabernacle or ark. A rude altar erected out of the stones of the ground was their temple. In Jacobs family were found terapliim or house hold gods. Sacrifice still retained the social as pect so that it meant little more than a family gathering at which the local deity was present. However, by this time Jehovah was recognized as the God of the Hebrews. Other acts of worship, such as prayer, vows and dreams were observed. There were very few if any hymns at this time. The law had not been fully compiled, and a limited literature. III. This division introduces us to the Canaanitish state. Great changes took place during .his epoch, because the people of Israel discontinued their nomadic life and settled down in the promised land among tribes of foreign faith. We naturally find that the cho sen people suffered no little contamin ation, of which subsequent history is evidence. Sacred places increased in numbers and the worship of Baal flourished. It seems to be a time of degeneration, for the worship of Jehovah was cor rupted. The ark containing the two tables of stone was transported from one place to another. Images were erected to represent the deity, and the Urim and Thmnmim were employed to ascertain the will of God. Sacrifice was regarded as communion with the deity. The burnt offering seems to havebeen used more than any other. Prayer, vows, visions were still observed, while sorcery was los ing its bold. Having discontinued their wandering life they observed the Sabbath, the feasts of the moon and of harvest. It appears, however, that they were not free from corruption. Music and dancing liad its place, and it is said of David as a later time that he danced. There were hymns, such as the exodus song, the song of De borah and the song of Hannah. Lnjvs were assuming form as the outgrowth of custom. They were not written by Moses, but compiled or formulated by him. IV. The prophetic stage. This pe riod is so called because of the number of prophets who exercised a most wholesome influence on the life of the people. This was done by teaching a more enlightened conception of God. Samuel, David, Elijah, Elisha. Isaiah and Jonah were among those who raised the standard of living. The high placed were still used for the worship of Baal, and at one time the worship of Baal and Jehovah were consolidated. At the time of David the ark of the covenant was taken to Je rusalem, and the temple, was com pleted in the days of Solomon, which produced a more orderly system of worship. Idolatrous practices were not, however, entirely superseded, for we read of golden calves at Bethel and Gilgal. The completion of the temple made the most perfect organization and de velopment of the priesthood impera tive. To this time no distinction was known between church and state, but the division of the monarchy in 075 produced a complete separation. Tlie acts of worship continued about the same as In the preceding period, except that certain restrictions were imposed. Sacrifice was offered to es tablish communion with God. There was some human sacrifice. Praying to God was becoming a pleasure, and vows were made by Nazarites. Ora- les and dreams were regarded tys chan- nels through which Jehovah commu nicated His revelations. Sorcery was practiced against the protests of the prophets. A hymn book was in pro cess of compilation and the priests were compiling law. The attitude of the prophets toward existing conditions will help us to ap preciate our theme and make its ap plication. The prophets considered the high places as detrimental to the religious life of the nation. They maintained that the temple was all they required for the worship of the true God. The prophets insisted upon purity of life among the people of God, espe cially the priests. It appears from the records that the sacred office was not entirely free from corruption. They further insisted upon the true worship of the heart. While admit ting the place of forms, they contend ed that the forms must be spiritual ized."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Hannah"], "snippet": "and the song of <mark>Hannah</mark>.
