The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

The parties indicted and the import ant witnesses had all made fiatly contradictory statements and an im penetrable mystery seemed to overhang the tragedy. There bad been a negro frolic and dance, the parliciputs, male and female,- be coming uproarious from whiskey. On the way home Bob Boler, Letitia Carson, George Flowers aud Charles Robertson were walking together apart from the othei s.

The joint convention of the Dem ocrats of Appomattox and Campbell counties, to nominate a candidate to the constitutional convention, met at West Appomattox on last Satur day the 20th instant. The original arrangement was for this cou veiltiou to be held at Kustburg, but inasmuch its the Campbell delegates had instructed  Judge Nelson to cast the vote of Campbell for such person as Appo mattox might present as her choice, Judge Nelson kindly accepted the invitation of the Democratic chair man of Appomattox to meet the delegates of the latter county at this place. Judge Frank Nelson was called upon to preside over the joint con vention, and Mr. T. A. Smith was chosen secretary. Col. R b. Poore in a few graceful remarks placed in nomination the Hon. H. D. Flood. Judge Nelson tempoiarily vacated the chair in or der to second the nomination. Iu the course of his earnest and cordi al remarks the Judge took occasion to disavow in the mos. emphatic manner the rumors which he learn ed had reached Appomattox of a purpose on the part of the Demo crats of Campbell, or of some mem bers of he party, to contest with Appomattox the choice of the nomi nee for the constitutional conven tion. He said that it was thorough ly understood, always had beeu, and always would be, that Appomattox was entitled to choose ihe nominee for the floater of the House of Del egates, and tUat the same principle was recognized uow iu the choice of a nominee for the constitutional convention. In a very haudsome and eiequent manner Judge Nelson affirmed that Campbell couuty had reasi to be proud of the two distinguished gen- tlemeu in whose nomination to the constitutional convention she had participated aud he declared that the names of John W. Daniel and H. JJ. Flood were associated togeth er iu the minds aud admiration of the people of Virgiuia as two of the noblest aud most gifted sons whom the fertile womb of the mother of s ates and statesmen had ever pro duced. The nomination of Mr. Flood was thereupon carried by acclamation. Messrs. IS. P. Colemau, C. H. Fur- bush and A. H. Clement were appointed a committee to wait upon Mr. Flood aud bring him before the convention. The appearance of the committee iu charge of the nominee, with his blushing honors thick upon him, was the signal for enthusiastic ap plause. Mr. Flood accepted the nomination in a brief address iu which he feelingly aud eloquently expressed his sense of the great honor conferred upon him, an honor that was the more highly appreci ated because it had been bestowed without any solicitation on his part and then iu a clear and forcible style outlined his general views upon the important questions that would come before the constitution al convention. Col. L. S. Marye, who was pres ent, yielded to repeated calls of the convention, and made a brief ad dress expressing the great gratifica tion he felt in this high honor con ferred upon his young and talented friend, Mr. Flood. Ho declared that the work to which his young friend was about to be called, that of framing an organic law and chart of government, was the highest and noblest task that could engage the powers of the human intellect. The convention thereupon ad journed with every manifestation of the cordiality, good feeling and enthusiasm which characterized its deliberations. ____"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["R", "Poore"], "snippet": "was chosen secretary.

Court day a fairly good crowd was iu attendance, and after the voice of the auctioneer had died away the crowd began to thin out and move for home. It was about 2 p. m. when the remainig crowd was sum moned into the courthouse, with Messrs. S. L. Ferguson and N. W. Owen as officers of the meeting, to consider the question of whether the County Court system should be dis placed for the District Courts, as provided for by the report of the committee in the Constitutional Con vention. Messrs. J . W. Flood, 8 . L. Fergu son, R. B. Poore and A. H. Clement took part in the discussiou, Messrs. Flood and Ferguson favoring the retention of the County Court and Messrs. Poore and Clement favoiing the report of the committee, which committee would give Appomattox a court every other month, with Judge Hundley on the bench. It is true, if the committees report is adopted by the Convention, we would lose Judge Christian as our county judge so would every other counu lose its judge. . It is but far to the gentlemen who desire to retain the old County Court to admit that it affords a tine opportunity for trading, exchanging views, and learning of each others fortunes aul misfortunes every MOftsl.Viit it Utails a great expense upon toe whole county to maintain this system of sociability, when so few people avail themselves of its exquisite joys and exuberation. If we may be permitted to view the matter from a personal stand point, the County Court is far better for us in every wayas a lawyer, courts come oftener and there are more chances for court ousiuess as a newspaper, the system affords a monthly pay-day for our patrons to come in and pay up aud subscribe, and tell us the news. Again, the merchants here, and in fact the en tire town, no doubt favors the sys temfor the very reasons which we have stated. it is our humble and candid opinion that the judiciary of the State of Virginia will be grea ly benefited, and the expenses greatly- reduced, by abolishing the Courts. Aud, although those present Court day, by a large majority, voted for the resolutions offered by Supt. Haunah requesting Delegate Flood to oppose the abolishment of County Courts, we trust he will not do so, because this meeting was not called for this purpose, and it had no right to instruct our delegate iu the Con vention, who represents not only the entire county of Appomattox but the people of Campbell as well. Mr. Flood knows the situation, has heard the discussion of the question in the Convention, and surely the people can trust him to do the right thing in the matter. Our people should not seek to tie the delegates hands in this manner. He has not asked for instructions dont bind him to vote against his ripe judgment, experience, and con victions. Let the County Court go give us a large court with a good docket every other month instead."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["R", "Poore"], "snippet": "8 . L. Fergu son, <mark>R</mark>.

He wr.s born, and rear d to early manhood here in Apac-.r ttex. Although hi.- life work necessitated his residence away in other localities, his abid ing interest in his native county made him throughout his life one of us. The early years of his life spent here was during that trying perio-d following the Civil War When few had imeans beyond bare subsis tence, and faw found means for more than the most elementary ed ucation. While toiling on the farm to h.lp his father care for his family, he sought an education be yond the advantages of the one room schools cf the county. Colon el R. B. Poore, rn attorney of ths county, actuated by his interest in helping young men handicapped by the lack cf school facilities, offer ed to give private instruction to a class of young nun. Meade Fergu- on avail ng himself of this oppor tunity, while working on the farm walked more than five miles to the county seat to take special instruc tion from Colonel Poore, including Latin and other studies necessary rut his entrance into college. With this preliminary training, he entered the V. P. I. where he found means of working his way through to graduation. Ater grad uation he taught in Vu it school. La ter he went abroad and took post graduate work in the Universities of Europe, specializing -in bacter iology, in which he took his doc tors degree. For many years he had been ! bacteriologist in the state depart ment of agriculture, where he ren- ! d e r e d distinguished servie--, , doing a great deal of work for the health department. Although Dr. Fergusons work was not directly connected with agricultural pursuits he never lost his interest in those who tilled the soil, and never failed to render every possible assistance to the farmers of the state. For a number of years he was editor of the Southern riar.ter. He, more then any other individual was responsible for the introduction of the Grange organization into the state. At great personal sacri fice in addition to his duties in the department of agriculture, he be came Master of the State Grange, and was serving his third term at the time cf his death. He had much to do with the growth of the organization in the state. Dr. Ferguson was twice married. iiL first wife was Mi-s Margaret  R bmson, of Fincasteo, Va.

Mrs. Calvin Robinson, president of the U. D. C., today released con tents of this aged notebook, supplied her through the cooperation of H. A. Gurney, Custodian here for the National Park Service. It appears that on Friday, May 18, 1866, the ladies of Old Appo mattox Court House and vicinity met in the court room to form a Ladies Association similar to the Ladies Memorial Association in oth er parts of the South. The object was to provide suitable interment for the Confederate Soldiers and to preserve the final resting place as a memorial. Temporary officers were Presi dent, Mrs. E, W. Leyburn Secre tary, Mrs. L. K. Read Treasurer, Mrs. J. C. Peers. On May 25, 1866, a second meeting was held and the first officers were chosen, to serve for one year President, Mrs. E. W. Leyburn Vice-President, Mrs. Eliz. Johns Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. Ella W. Flood Recording Sec retary, Mrs. Lizzie K. Read Treas urer, Mrs. Jonnie C. Peers. At this meeting Mr. Joel W. Flood offered to give land for the purpose of a cemetery. Among the first members were Mesdames E. W. Leyburn, Elizabeth Johns, Jennie C. Peers, Lizzie K. Read, Bettie Tweedy, Sally F.

Major Flood donated timber for a fence. Capt. Wm. H. Trent and Maj. Flood arranged to haul the timber. Mr. Francis Meeks cleared the ground for the Memorial Cemetery. An early feature of the Ladies Organization was a series of memor ial addresses. Col, Farrar made the entertained by Maj. Wilmer Mc Lean. A Tableau was presented as a means of raising funds. A similar ladies group in Charlotte offered to help. The digging of the graves for the Veterans was done by Messers. Geo. T. Peers, C. H. Sackett, P. N. Meade, J. W. Webb, R. R. Kyle, Geo. A.
