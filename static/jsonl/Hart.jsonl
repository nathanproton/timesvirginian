Americans cannot but regard with interest the Victoria falls of Zambesi river, South Africa, which are over 400 feet high and produce in the wet season energy estimated by engineers at 35,000,000 horse power, as against 7,000,000 pro duced by Niagara. A railroad now under donstrnction, will reach the falls by March next, after which date a bridge over the river and an electric plant comparable with that at Niagara falls will be constructed.  It is believed, says the Electrical Review,  that it will be practicable to carry the electric energy gene rated at the falls economically, even as far as the Rand, and it is hoped to work by means of it a large pro portion of the South African Rail way mileage, as well as to supply the power needed t the gold mines. American estimates are that, with conditions similar to those in Rho- desia, it will be possible to convey the current 330 miles and deliver it at a cost of twenty-two dollars a kilowatt a year, the load being on for the whole 24 hours of the day. Within a radius of 300 miles of the falls are included the Wankie coal fields, Bulawayo, the Gweio, Sebak- we, Selnkwe, Lomagunda and Hart ley gold fields, the Northern copper fields and about 900 miles of railway line while a transmission of 600 miles would. taKe in the whole of the South African gold fields.

A year or so ago. he says, an American, who had settled in Bahia, the second largest city in Brazil, was made an election clerK, ard was told to bring the returns from an interior towm into Bahia. After the electron had closed, the clerk took the returns nd hastened away, guarding them with the greatest car. He rode his horse hart, for he felt that the sus pense would be great at Bahia until the returns he was carrying were received. What was his chagrttl, therefore, to hand his package over to the chiet election clerk, only to, see it thrown into the waste-basket. .  Here, what are you doing? he shouted. . Throwing them away, was the an swer, we dont need-them now.  Dont need them? stammered the American, who had been brought up to regard a violation of the election laws as treasonable. .  The government has eiccted its men already, was the answer we don t need any more voles.  Here the inspector opened the pack age and showed the astonished Ameri can a quantity of blanks, each of which was signed, with a space to be fills! in with any number necessary to elect the government candidates.  ----------- - --------- -  man Amusements Halls tor our Soldiers. wj1QS A year ago Congress appropriated five hundred thousand 4ollars for the construction and equipment of amuse- ment halls at first-class army posts, and the p a building for this purpose to cost one H hundred and twenty-five thousand dol- A lars is to be constructed at Fort Myer. lars.

Lamartine tells us tbat King Nimrod said to hls three sons, Hero aro three yokes, and one is ot clay, another of amber, and another ot gold. Choose now which yon will have. The eldest son, having first ohoice, chose the vase of gold, on whloh was written the word Empire, and when opened it was found to contain human blood. The second son, making tho next, choice, ohose the vase ot aml0r.Jns with the 1 nuTwM f openod I  jUma the ashes of these who were Called great. The third son took tho of clay, and, oponing It, found it _ ptv bat on the bottom of it was in- scrlral the name ot God. King Nimrod asked bis oourtlers whloh vase they thought weghed the most. The avaricious men ot hiseourt said the vase of gold. The poets said the one of amber. But tho wisest men said the empty vase, because ono letter ot the name of God outwoighed a universe. For Him I thirst for Hte gram I beg on Hls promise I build my all. Without Him I cannot be happy. I have tried the world, and it does well enough as far it goes, but It Is too uncertain a world, too evanescent a world. I am not a prejudiced witness. I have nothing against this world.

Life to many has been n disappointment, bnt to me It bas been a pleasant surprise, and yet I de clare that It I did not feel tbat God was now my Friend and ever-present help, I should be wretched and t error at icken.

By the way, your Arvonia writer says the candidates must make themselves understood on the whis key question. That writer has horse sense. The band wagon is up to you, Mr. Candidate, show your colors, or get left.

Your Buckingham writer ib the first. I dont know how any one so deaf as he can hear so much. Mr. Cary McCraw and Mr. Wm. Shaw were good friends and loved to rig each other. Mr. McCraw was an auctioneer. At one of our county courts he was selling a horsi and a great crowd was around hiui. Mr. Shaw, in the outskirts, said, Hold him up Cary, hold him up, heres a fellow that made a bid, cant you hear?   Yeq, Mr, Mc- Cri w said,  I hear a good many things about you 1 dont want to hear. So it is I suppose with the Buckingham writer, he heats some tilings if he is deaf that he dont want to hear. Anyway we read him first and then turn to the Farmville man and read everything we see from there. The first sweet heart we ever had lived in Farm ville, and we have loved the town ever since. Few are jiow living that were then in mans estatein the fifties. Meade Davidson, Mr. Hart and Charley all I now remember and Ned Erambert of gosling state Sam Paulette and Bob Miler were juat kids they did go in the army and I dont remem ber whether they wore knee pants or not. 1 dont remember the fashions for boys then, I know the women had hoops and my! what big ones some did wear. It is said that one of the boys in Appomattox got a set, or pair, whatever they call them and a long-eared bonnet and raised the sympathy of th. enrolling officer, telling him of her poor husbands sufferiag in the ar my and was left quietly hoeing the trnck patch. Well when we got to talking about women we got clean off Sam, and Bob and the knee pants. The next war I get into I shall wear them. You see a fellow can get to the rear faster. If I had the pen of a reaay writ er like your Farmville man, 1 wonld like so to tell of the old folks. I would go from Mr. Warrens to Jenkins Shop on the west and Hil lards to the foundry on the east of Main. How many hundreds have passed over the river of death since then. Months of Sundays in tne evening did I hear Dr. Wm. Hoge preach Blind Bartimeus by the wayside? I heard he put his ser mons in book form. I have never seen a copy. I have got no bad news to write except Percy Spencers misfortune. I hear his left arm was cat off at the shoulder I dont know the par ticulars. Percy was a good boy, so far as we-know or believe.

The proposed combination, author ized under the transportation act, is designed to remove weaknesses in the national railroad system shown by the operation of the rate-making power of the commission and to effect readjust ment of terminal and other subsidiary facilities, with resultant economy in operation and delivery of shipments. Weak lines which have shown their inability to live under rate schedules profitable to stronger roads would, un der the plan, be attached to systems more advantageously situated, but it was announced that in every case the effort was made to maintain the identi ty of existing strong systems. Hearings will be called by the com mission for the purpose of discussing the- proposed consolidations. Since, under the law, no plan can he adopted which has not been given the approval of the individual lines affected as well as that of the commission, it was ex pected that discussion would be pro longed and that a number of modifi cations from the plan made public to day would be suggested. We have sought to minimize dis memberment of existing lines and sys tems, the commissions announcement said.

Accord ing to this story, the legations suc cumbed only after an all-night attack. The forces of Prince Tuan defeated the regular troops of Prince Ching and of Wang Weng Shao before the foreign ers were slaughtered. Minister Wu has received at Wash ington a dispatch from Sh\u00e8hg, at Shanghai, saying that a Chinese gen eral was preparing ts bombard thq. for eign legation! in Pekin July 7. A Shanghai dispatch, said t\u00f2 be official from Chinese sources, says that the le gations had fallen and foreigners had been massacred before the departure from Pekin of a courier July 2. According to a London dispatch. Lady Hart, wife of Sir Robert Hart, Di rector of Imperial Maritime Chinese Customs, has received the following message from her husband, dated July 5 Our people, including the women, are in the legations. Prepare to hear the worst. The only substantial doubt thrown on the story is by Li Hung Chang, Who stated at Canton that several of the legations W\u00e8r\u00e8 still safe, and that hone of th\u00e8 minister, \u00e9xfcept Vdp E\u00e8tteier, has be\u00e9n killed. The fact that n\u00f2 two stories agree perfectly as to the date of the massacre tends also to discredit them. Nearly all accounts have come originally from Chinese sources, and it is thought that the dates may have been juggled with. Dispatches from Tientsin tell of stub born fighting between the allies and the Chinese. Admiral Seymour has sent reports to London indicating that the allies are at least holding their own. He says that the foreign garri son has been reinforced by 1500 Ameri cans, presumably including the Ninth Infantry. The powers are said to have reached an agreement as to Chinese policy. They hav .practically given Up hope of saving the legations in Pekiri, and will not make an advance, it is said, until it can be done in overwhelming force.

I tell you tlie praises of th needle. From the fig leaf robe prepared in the garden of Eden to the last stitch taken on the garment for the poor the needle has wrought wonders of Kindness, generosity and benefaction. It adorned the girdle of the high priest, it fashioned the curtains in the ancient tabernacle, it cushioned the chariots of King Solomon, it provided the robes of Queen Elizabeth, ana in high places and in low places, by the fire of the pioneers back log and un der the flash of the chandelierevery whereit has clothed nakedness, it ha preached the gospel, it has overcome hosts of penury ana want with the war cry of Stitch, stitch, stitch! The operatives have found a livelihood by it, ana through it the mansions of the employer are con structed. Amid the greatest triumphs in all ages and lands I set down the conquests of the needle. I admit its crimes I admit its cruelties. It has had more martyrs than the fire it has punctured the eye it has pierced the side it has struck weakness into the lungs it has sent madness into the brainy it has filled the potters field it has pitched whole armies of the suffer ing into crime and wretchedness and woe. But now that I am talking of Dorcas and her ministries to the poor I shall apeak only of the charities of the needle. This woman was a representative of all those who make garments for the destitute, who knit socks ior the barefooted, who prepare bandages for the lacerated, who fix up boxes of clothing for missionaries, who go into the asylums of the suffering and desti tute bearing that gospel which is sight for the blind and hearing for tlie deaf, and which makes the lame man leap like a hart and brings the dead _ to life, immortal health bounding in their pulses. What a contrast between tbe practical benevolence of this woman and a great deal of the charity of this day!
