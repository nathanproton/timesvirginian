Grave tfl Past Achievement. Trieste, the great seaport ot today, is about twenty-five miles distant tfl the southwest. All the marks of ths prosperity and importance of Aquileia have fled to Trieste, In the east, and to Venice, in the west. The once busy harbor is choked with slit and drifting dunes, while rafts and fishing boats are almost the only craft that now thread the varying channels. The modi ern village, counting 2,300 people, is unhealthy on account of its rice fluids and is neglected and forgotten. Aquileia is a grave of past achlove- ment and a much-weathered monument of the world of the Roman ago Its museum is rich In trophies of Roman times and Its ancient cathedral and the remains of the patriarchs palace are Its most eloquent concrete memo rles. Aquileia, as Is much of the north ern and western coast of the Adriatic, is a rich field for archeologists and antiquarians. The city is said to have been colo nized by the Romans as a frontier fortress against the Celts In 183 B. In 168 A D. Marcus Aurelius made It one of the strongest fortified positions In the empire. During Hadrians reign its population reached the 600,000 mark. Attlla destroyed the city In 452 A. D., and It never recovered Its greatness. Aquileia was great and strong only throughout Its Roman history, when, during Its prime. It ranked immediately after the Eternal city Itself. Its fortunes were those of the Roman world, and modern Italy, looking back over the gulf of centu ries, feels Itself not only the descend ant, but also the heir of Latin Rome."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["rice"], "snippet": "on account of its <mark>rice</mark> fluids and is neglected"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["rice"], "snippet": "on account of its <mark>rice</mark> fluids and is neglected"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Stir often for the first hour or two, then let it brown. Bake for three hours. This is delicious without sauce, but a hard sauce fla vored with nutmeg makes it a dessert liked especially by the children and is a most wholesome one for them. Molasses Cookies.Take a cupful of shortening, a cupful of molasses and a cupful of brown sugar. Heat In a saucepan until well mixed, then add ginger or other spices to taste, a half teaspoonful of soda, dissolved In a little hot water and flour enough to roll but. If the mixture is cooled well before rolling It will handle better. Apple Sauce Cake.Take a cupful of brown sugar, a half cupful of short ening. a cupful of unsweetened apple sauce, made from cooking apples, a cupful of raisins, chopped, two tea spoonfuls of cocoa, a teaspoonful of cinnamon, a half teaspoonful each of cloves and nutmeg, two cupfuls of flour, sifted with a half teaspoonful of soda, and one teaspoonful of bak ing powder. Bake forty minutes in a shallow pan. This makes a good des- sert served with a lemon sauce or any desired flavor.
