AJao, under tbe Cannon rnles, tbe Speaker was chairman of the power ful committee on rules, and since he bad the appointment of his brother members on that committee, he ac tually controlled the shaping aDd direction of all legislation brought before the House. Under the pre sent rales, not only is the Speaker shorn of bis former autocratic power to appoint members of com mittees, and thns to control the ac tion of the committees, bnt he him self is not permitted to be a member of the committee on roles. Not content with the above-men tioned changes, the House progres sives adopted certain rnles which changed the committees from arbi trary bodies to advisory bodies, and which greatly enlarged the power and influence of the individual members of the Honse. For in stance, under the Cannon rnles, the chairman of a committee could practically prevt a vote being taken on a measure which had been referred to bis committee while un der the prednt rules, although a committee cnairman is influential and powerful when it comes to shaping legislation coming before his committi e, he cannot prevent thy Honse from voting as to whet her or not a measure shall pass the House. The standpat Republicans, toget her with a few reactionary Demo crata, most of whom have since been retired to the shades of private life, fought hard againss the revision of the Cannon rnle, bnt tbey were overwhelmingly defeated, the new rnles were adopted, and Cannon- ism took its place among the things that used to be. In the fighting that preceded tbe final victories of the progressives in the lower Honse of Congress, Mr. Flood was always on the firing line, and he, together with Bepresenta tives A. Mitchell Palmer of Penn sylvania, Clande Kitchin of North Carolina, and James Hay of Vir ginia, ably assisted Bepresentative Oscar W. Underwood of Alabama in the bringing about of those pro gressive reforms that practically re stored to the people the power to shape legislation in the halls of Congress. Previously, when tbe Bepnbli- cans were in control of the Honse, Mr. Flood had frequently attacked the reactionaries who had entrench ed themselves behind the Gannon rnles, and on one occasion when the infamy of those rnles was under discussion on the floor of the Honse, particularly with reference to their application to a bill for the relief of the tobacco growers of Virginia, the member from the Tenth Dist rict, himself the author of a mea sure having for its purpose the re- ief of the Virginia growers, rose in his seat, and by the grace of Mr. Speaker Cannon, delivered a most forctble address in which he scored the antocratic power exercised by the Cannon regime, which, be re marked, had taken from the mem bers of the HonBe the powers dele gated to them by the Federal Con stitntion. Space does not permit me to give yon more than a taste of the milit ant progressivism with which that particular speech was charged, so 1 must content myself with quoting one small paragraph, reserving for my next weeks letter a fuller ac count of the speech, whioh itself alone stamps Henry D. Flood as one of that band of active progres sives whose efforts jrill be a step nearer fnll fruition when Woodrow Wil.on takes his sent in the White Honse. Mr. Flood said When Oliver Cromwell cleared ont liie Parliinent Honse with a file of soldier, it whb no whit more tyranmoal, no whit moie subversive sf the fundamental principles of representative government, than this aeeumptiou of a power which should only be exercised by a ma jority of -this Honse,namely tbe power to legislate. The above words are a matter of record. Tbey stamp the man who uttered them as the kind of fight ing progressive who counts.

The ruling, one of the most import ant since the advent of national pro hlbition, makes it possible for all alco holic liquors to be used for medical and other nombeverage purposes, and for all to be manufactured and sold for these purposes subject only to the limitations of the Volstead Act on nonbeverage intoxicants. The opinion was written by former Attorney General Palmer the day b\u00e9 fore he retired from office, and was in reply to a series of questions from internal revenue and prohibition offi cials bearing on construction of half a dozen moot points in the law. t There are many rumors afloat that the opinion had wrecked plans of dry advocates of liquor sales. Officials re fused to comment on the reports, how ever, but Wayne B. Wheeler, general counsel of the Anti-saloon League is sued a statement in which he said that 39 States had State codes pro hibiting the prescribing of beer for medicinal purposes. Mr Wheeler de clared the opinion was not in accord with -the purpose of the Federal law. Congress clearly did not intend to attempt to legalize what the State laws prohibit, Mr. Wheeler said Unless the opinion is overruled Con gress should amend th\u00e9 law. It is difficult, of course, to overrule it be cause the Government and the brew ers are on the same side of the case and there is no one to contest it un less the new Attorney General over rules the opinion. The opinion appeared ambiguous in some respects, officials said, and as a result they were unable to determine whether the government had power. In the Hght of the ruling, to limit the number of prescriptions which a phy sician may write, except that the law specifies no more than a pint per per son in a ten-day period. Mr. Palmer declared he believed it the purpose of Congress to leave the physician unfettered by governmental control, yet he thought that regulations might properly restrict the amount to be sold on any one prescription. Mr. Palmer called attenion to pro visions of law which, apparently, had left the physician to act on his judg ment. He suggested then that when a physician abused the privilege he could be dealt with criminally, but added that In no case should the judg ment of the physician be supplanted by that of enforcement officials, a situation he -believed would result from regulations attempting to con trol the use of prescriptions. Replying to the question whether the Government could restrict the number, of permits to manufacture, sell or prescribe in any State or com munity, Mr. Palmer explained that the Volstead Act had limited only the classes to which permits could be issued and had permitted no discrimi nation between persons within those classes. He said the withholding of permits could not be done legally, even though officials were convinced that fewer permits would suffice in any given State or city. Mr. Palmer advised officials that they had ample authority to writ1? such regulations as -they believed necessary to make certain the en forcement of the law.

M Landis, of Chicago, was I impeached in the House of Representa I lives bv Representative Welty Demo- I crat of Ohio, because of his accept- I ance of the office of supreme arbitrator I of baseball while still serving on the I bench. In taking this step the Ohio mem- I ber swept aside an opinion by Attor- I ney General Palmer that Judge Lan- I dis was within the law and that there I was no law making such acceptance I a crime, either misdemeanor or fel- I ony. The opinion was rendered re- I cently by the Attorney General on the I written request of Mr. Welty, who I had questioned the Judges right to I hold both positions. I Before proceeding to the floor of I the House, where his charges were I read, Mr. Welty refused a request by I Senator Dial Democrat of South I Carolina, to include in the general  Indictment statements attributed to  Judge Landis in refusing to send to I Jail a young Ottawa 111. bank clerk I because of the Judges belief th a t1 officials of the bank were responsible  for the clerks peculation by failure j to pay him a living wage. Senator Dial, on receiving the Ohio j representatives refusal, announced he would file complaint against Judge Landis with the Department of Justice,  and late in the day attacked the Chicago jurist on the floor of the Sen-  ate, describing him as a freak and a  crank. The South Carolina Senator i i characterized Judge Landis state-, ment that the Ottawa bank clerks   employers were, in a measure, re sponsible for the youths theft of 96,000 as the most bolshevik doctrine I ever heard. and added that if the action taken by the judge in paroling the clerk is to be encouraged, it is striking at the foundations of our gov ernment. There was no comment in the House when Mr. Welty concluded the reading of a formal indictment of Judge Lan dis. On his own motion, as is customary In such proceedings, the indictment was referred to the Judiciary Com mittee without debate. Less than a third of the members present voted, and a number of scattering voices were lifted in opposition. Nobody asked for a rising vote. Representa tive Sherwood, Democrat, of Ohio, sit ting on the front row, clapped his hands, hut otherwise there was no in dication as to how the House felt. The next step will be by Mr. Welty, who will appear, possibly this week, before the Judiciary Committee, with such witnesses as he sees fit to call, to amplify his charges. The commit tee will then decide whether to go ahead with the case. It has the power to dismiss the charges and so report to the House, and adoption of such a report would exonerate Judge Landis of the charges preferred by Mr. Welty. Belief was expressed in House circles that the case would be thrown out by the committee, in view of the opinion by the Attorney General. In that event the end would come before adjournment of Congress on March 4. Adjournment, however, would not stop proceedings should the committee find enough evidence to send the case on to the House. The impeachment proceedings the Judiciary Committee acts in a simi lar capacity to a justice of the peace. The House -s the grand jury, and if the House indicts it transmits its find- lnP t0 the Senate, which becomes the trial court.

It is less, in fact, than the income tax levy by any Eu ropean country, and the American who vents his resentment on this country because of its new income tax law will have to flee to some uncivilized coun try to escape payment of this tax.

The plan ohxploration adopted is for the two iibreakers to drive as near to the oast as possible and launch their llicopters. Although it will be wintefn the northern hemi sphere, the eedition will have the advantage oftperating during the Antarctic sumer. Personnel will live aboard th Edisto and the Bur ton Island, adding the difficulties of setting up base ashore, as was done by last jxrs larger navy ex pedition.

This theory will be checked, it w understood, even though there istle evidence to support it in thejrrounding frigid wastes of the arctic, because such a change, it progress, would have portentous iteorological im plications.

Approximately 800 names will hereafter become eligi ble annually for succeeding Who Was Who volumes. At present a viscount, eight Presi dents of the United States, a premier of a republic the government of which is now in exile, and- 27,447 others meet the two reo.uirements for listing in Who Was Who. The viscount is William Waldorf Astor. The eight Presidents are Cleveland, Coolidge, Harding, Har rison, McKinley, Theodore Roose velt, Taft and Wilson.

Among the 27,447 others whose sketches as last published in Whos Who now reappear in Who Was Who with the dates of their deaths added, are American leaders from Civil war days to the present. This long span which the volume covers brings famous figures of past dec ades such as Alexander Graham Bell, Sarah Bernhardt, Chauncey Depew, Anna Held, Mme. Nellie Mel ba, Potter Palmer, James Whitcomb Riley and Mark Twain, into its pages beside leaders of recent years like Jane Addams, Sherwood Anderson, William E. Borah, Louis D. Bran d\u00e9is, Arthur Brisbane, Thomas A. Edison, Daniel Frohman, George W. Goethals and Robert M. LaFollette. One, that of a woman, mentions relief work on battlefields during the Civil war and the organization at her own expense of searches for missing men. It is the last Whos Who sketch of Clara Barton, first presi dent of the American Red Cross. Another lists employment in 1860 as a pony express rider. It is Buf falo Bill Codys sketch. Sketch Successes. Many of the sketches are strik ing examples of the opportunity this country has offered for exceptional advancement and achievement. A typical sketch of this type, beginning with farm work and clerking for four years, ends with a mention of a mil- lion-dollar gift to a museum. It is Marshall Fields. Other business men whose sketches recall intimate details of unusually interesting commercial and industrial careers are those of James C. Fargo, whose enterprise became the American Express com pany Robert Dollar, who started in a lumber camp and became one of the worlds leaders in ocean ship ping Harvey Firestone, who began with 17 employees in the rubber business and finally employed 40,000 Edward Harriman, clerk who be came railroad king  Henry Flag ler, another clerk who personally owned 600 miles of railroad before he died Julius Rosenwald, who started in the wholesale clothing business but bought control of a struggling mail order business Sears, Roebuck and Co.which had to have clothing to fulfill some of its advertising offers John H.

Miles  records that in 1864 he commanded an army corps of 26.000 men at 25 years of age. Henry Clews, the financier, who recorded in his sketch that during the Civil war the secretary of the treasury in Lincolns cabinet placed him in charge of the sale of bonds for continuing the war, and as well that later General Grant -recom mended him as advisor to Japan in setting up its financial system, also reported that he had originally studied for the ministry.

What is the duty of Virginia free men in the present great crises ? Let every voter reflect well before he casts his ballot. It has been rare in the history of this great country that so important an elec tion has engaged the attention of the American people. It is emphat ically a critical crucial period. What is the condition of affairs here at home ? Land in Southside V ir ginia is down to fifty cents an acre in many places and is unsaleable even at that price. I saw in 1895 a tract of land in Buckingham con taining 600 acres sold at less than fifty cents an acre. It was within five miles of a railroad and a mower can be run over every foot of it, and it is fertile and well timbered and in a good neighborhood, convenient to churches and schools. Farm products are below the cost of pro duction. No man wants land be cause he cannot make any profit in cultivating it. What is true of Buckingham is true of every county in Virginia. Indeed Buckingham is far more than an average county, its land is rich and productive and its timber and mineral resources are very great. No farmer can employ a hand even as low as seven dollars a month and find him and make a cent from the sale of farming pro ducts. T h i volume of money in Virginia is less than 5 per capita circulation and is decreasing. Our laborers cannot get employment at any price and thousands of them are forced to emigrate. I cannot tell how many have come to me this year ana said Captain Patteson we are ready to work for you at any price you choose to give. The scarcity of money has filled our highways and byways with tram ps it has filled our prisons and asylums md is still doing its fatal work Despair, misery, want and suffering ire to be seen on eyery side. What the Romaus called the angusta res domi is felt in all sections of the and. Between 1880 and 1890 the population of every agricultural county in Virginia decreased and the decrease has been greater since 1890 than it was before. Buck ham, Cumberland and Fluvanna fell back . enormously. There are fewer white people in Buckingham md Cumberland to-day thau there were one hundred years ago. A s tonishing as is this statement it is true. Actually the beavers are omiug back and building their ams just as they did two centuries go. The trade of the trapper is becoming one of the few profitable employments. This state of things cannot last It is intolerable. I f it continues all over te State a year longer it will force a default in the interest on the Virginia century bonds it will cut down the appro priatiun for the free schools and probably cause their abandonment altogether. It will force the county levies to be lowered and the rate of taxation on land. It will cause the ilaries of officers including county and circuit judges to be cut down one half at least. It will cut down the appropriation for our asylums and will inevitably force a constitu- 1 tional convention. This is no fancy sketch.
