The Childrens Home Society has been at work about 20 years. It was organized in Virginia only two years ago. In this comparatively short time many children have been rescued from a wretched fate, fitt\u00e9d out in decent apparel and are now doing well in approved family home3. .The aim of the Society is 1. To find and obtain legal guar dianship of homeless children in Virginia. 2. To place these children in good family homes. 3. To see that the children thus, placed are not neglected or abused. 4. To save these children from pauperism aud crime, aud thus save the State from the grievous burden of taxation for their future care, aud from the danger of debased cit izenship arising from neglected childhood. The special features are 1. Systematic search for homes. 2. Constant outlook for depend ent and abused children, orphans, half orphans and worse than or phans. Many institutions do not take any but full orphans. 3. The Society has by law the gbt, with the sanction of the courts, to take children away from rossly cruel aud immoral parents. 4. Thorough organization, exten sive correspondence, distribution of literature, public addresses. 5. Strict economy, no costly build ings. Our aim is to place the child in a home with the least possible delay, in the meantime boarding them with some existing institution Rev. Wm. J. Maybee, the State Superintendent, was in West Appo mattox Sunday. He preached at the Methodist church in the morn ing and at Liberty Baptist at night. On this occasion there was a union service. All the pastors were pres ent. Mr. Maybee presented the claims and a local society was or ganized. Local Advisory Boards are organ ized in the centres of population to look after the interests of the Society in their respective communities, and report homeless children, and pass upon the character, social standing and financial ability of families in their neighborhood applying for children. The following were elected as our local board Messrs. S. L. Ferguson, A. H. Clement, J.R. Horsley and Dr. Julian Abbitt and Mesdames J. W. Flood, T. A. Smith and Ernest Gills. Miss Frances E. Willard, the philanthropist, said It is like all great discoveries, simple, practical, just the thing. We wonder where our wits were that we did not think of such a plan long ago. Persis tently followed out on a large scale, it will change the face of civiliza tion, cure poverty, kill out crime and bring forth the millenium. The work of the Society is pure charity. No charge is made for re ceiving a child or placing one in a family. All contributions are voluntary. All persons knowing of homeless or grossly abused children, and all persons who wish to take such children into their homes, should address Rev. Wm. J. Maybee, State Superintendent, Box 635, Richmond, Va., or see some member of the local board.

Mrs. Nowlin went out on the porch and gave the alarm, and requested Constable N. W. Owen to arrest Mr. Nowlin, say ing that be had twice shot at her. Heury, a sou of Mr. Nowlin, came up, and went in search of his lather. He found him behind an outhouse. Mr. Nowlin said to him  Get my horse. I want you to carry me to Spout Spring. He spoke so ration ally that the young mau left him to go to the field and take a horse from the plow for bis fathers use in go ing to Spout Spring. Before leav ing his father, Heury tequested him to give up the pistol which he had concealed on his person. Mr. Now lin was searched, but no pistol was found. His son had proceeded ouly a few steps when Mr. Nowlin sent u bullet through his own brain. He eeled aud fell, and died within 30 minutes. The bullet entered his left temple and came out just above his right car. Diligent inquiry has not developed any cause whatever for the rasl. act of Mr. Nowlin, and, al though he was of a despondent dis position and very high-tempered, he had never had an attack that made him the mudmau he was on Friday. Those nearest to him claim that he was evidently cruzy, aud that is the general verdict of the people. He nad for years beeen a great sufferer from ueuralgia and his bodily health was generally rather infirm. Borne reports say that Mr. Nowlin became enraged at a negro servant on the place, and had no occasion to be an gry with his wife, who is one of the best ladies in our county. It is one of the saddest affairs that ever hap pened in this county, as the family upon both sides is well known and highly connected. The deceased was born about 62 years ago in the house in which he was piepared for burial. He was not a member of any church. While he was high-tempered and courageous, he had a warm heart, full of sympathy. He had beeu a merchant and postmaster at Oak ville most of his life, but was engaged in farming at the. time of his death. Besides his wife, who was a Miss Woodson, Mr. Now lin leaves six children. He is also survived by two brothers and two sisters Mr. S. Walker Nowlin, of Lynchburg Mr. William S. Nowlin, of Spout Spring Mrs. Samuel H. Overton, of Spout Spring and Mrs. John Hughes, of Oakville. His burial took place on Saturday even ing, at the family burying ground on the place, and was quite largely attended by friends of the family. Evergreen. We have had another fine rain. Crops are looking very well. The wheat is very good all through this part of the county. There is some complaint about the oats turning yellow in some places. The tobacco crop in general is rather small, but is growing well, and nearly every body has a good stand. The corn is looking green and is growing well. The crops of clover and grass are not of much account There are about 75 railroad men now at work here. - Alost of t.heni spend their nights in our village, anu it is something of a sight to see them come in at night. The mer chants report good sales now, espe cially of cider. They cant keep a supply of that equal to the demand. We are sorry to learn that little Gerard Davis is still very ill. Drs. Julian Abbitt and Walker are both attending him. Mr. Walter Davis has again been called to his bedside. Mrs. Sue Harvey continues very ill at her home near this place. Mrs. Ed. Hamilton has been call ed home in great haste to attend her husband, who is very ill of fever. Mrs. Nat. Gregory last week spent several days visiting her husband in and around this place. She won many friends by her pleasant man ners and sweet ways. We heartily hope that she had a pleasant visit, and that she will come again. Mr. N. H. Gregory left on Mon day for the Hill City.

Our special Washington cor respondent says of him The death of Flood is directly due to his fine devotion to his State and partv When tbs Republicans gave it out that they were going to break into the solid South and that Vir ginia was to be the gateway, everyone knew that it meant another loosening of the strings of the long purse that poured out millions and millions for the election of Harrison, Me Kinley, Roosevelt, Taft and Hardingthe long purse of privilege. The Virginia leaders looked over the field and could see no one but Flood to lea the fight to prevent the Repub licans again getting a foothold in the State that was still re- membring painfully the days of the carpet baggers So Flood wae drafted for the iob, though already Chairman of the Demo cratic Congressional Commit tee, he went into it like he went into every other fight with every ounce of force there was in him Of course he wod , aud the Democrats carried Vir ginia by the biggest majority ever known, but Flood came back to Washington and took to hi bed, never to leave it. Of him it can be truly said  He died with the harness on, the broad sword leaping, the wild fight surging fast  Rich as the party is in leadership, Democracy can ill spare him, this proud Virginian, proud of his clean hands, his clean pub tic record, Lis clean profession al career and his spotless personal character. It is re membered of bim that when he first came t j Congress, defeat ing Jacob Yost, a Republican, the result was very close ano he was offered the certificate of election on. a technicality, wbereu ton be refused to accept it, preferring to stand aside until the status of every ques cioned ba lot wae determined, be knew he might lose by so doing, but be preferred it that way. The folio wiug tribute paid our distinguished countyman by a life-long friend is worthy of both men Nobody seems to be able to realize chat Hal Flood, of Ap pomattox, is dead. We cannot grasp the fact that the mao of vigor and force and activity upon wuern we Had learned to rely, and under whose devoted watch care we had learned to feel secure has been suddenly called from his earthly duties, ank that our friend is no more. Mr. Floods great abilities and worth in public life were uaiversaly recognized. But to the people of Appomattox nr was held in esteem as nowhere else, because it was here that tiis worth in private life was best known.
