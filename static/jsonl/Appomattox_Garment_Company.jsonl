Mrs. Byers is employed by the Appomattox Garment Company, They are staying, temporarily, at the home of a daughter, Mr. and Mrs. L. M. Hooper, near Appomattox. Mrs. Byers said that Jenny, a birthday present, had always been a favorite pet of the family. She thinks that Jenny probably went from bed to bed the night of the fire, trying to awaken each sleeping member. We feel that she saved our lives, Mrs. Byers said. Mrs. Byers added that ho cause for the fire has been es tablished. A sons car was threatened by the blaze, but was driven away from the house in time. A kennel of hounds nearby, also, appear ed undamaged from the fire. As the Byers moved about the blackened remains of their home Monday, Mr. Byers remarked, We raised ten children through hard tiimes. Now weve lost all that we had, except our fami ly. Were grateful that we still have them all.

Although the growth of the Appomattox Garment Company cov ers the period from 1947 to date, full maturity of the opration dates back to the 1953-1954 period dur ing which the question of union representation was resovled. After a seventeen month strike, the non union status of those associated with the company was established, and subsequently the major de velopment has taken place. Because of the ability to main tain a full 40 hour work week, in contrast to abbreviated work weeks elsewhere, coupled with the above average hourly earnings made avail able by the company, take-home pay for the folks on the Appomat tox Garment Company team has pushed way ahead of the field. The company official stated that one of the most important advances that have been made within the organi zation has been the adoption of the most comprehensive health and wel fare program available anywhere. Complete hospital and surgical ben efits as well as a substantial week ly sum is promptly available to everyone that is out sick and un able to work. The company pays the total premium for this health security and perhaps the most un usual aspect of the program is the promptness of payments. Checks for all sick benefits are made out and paid on the same day the bills are submitted. In addition to Mr. Lawson, the policies of the Corporation are di rected by Robert Englander and Evelyn Bailey. In keeping pace with the rapid advancement of the com- patty,- two experienced executives joined the organization within the lpst six months. Mrs. Cottelle Phelps Triijillo, who originally hails from Appomattox and who was formerly the Manager of a local stitching operation, associated with the com pany last April. At about the same time, Mr. George Bunch, of Lynch burg, resigned his position as pro duction manager of a hand-bag firm to also affiliate with The Garment Company. When interviewed relative to the future of our local industry, Mr. Englander stated without reserva tion that prospects are better to day than they have been any time iij my recollection. The period a- head is unquestionably going to separate the men from the boys in industry and in our particular bus iness, companies that have develop ed a firm technical and organiza tional foundation allowing them to compete favorably in what we ex pect to be a highly competitive harket, wtfll realize accomplish ments that would have been con sidered impossible, ten years ago. Mr. Englander went on to say that one of the reassuring sources of satisfaction our firm hs experienc ed during the past year or so is the number of competing garment pro ducers that have visited with us to observe our methods of manufactur ing. We gr always delighted to have our competitors visit with us n,ver fearing .any ill effects as the one important possession we have is the people with whom we work and that is something they cannot take away in their notebooks. ,"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Garment", "Company"], "snippet": "the growth of the <mark>Appomattox</mark> <mark>Garment</mark> <mark>Company</mark> cov ers the period"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Appomattox", "Garment", "Company"], "snippet": "the growth of the <mark>Appomattox</mark> <mark>Garment</mark> <mark>Company</mark> cov ers the period"}], "text_match": 1736172819517014137, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315704397824", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172819517014137", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}
