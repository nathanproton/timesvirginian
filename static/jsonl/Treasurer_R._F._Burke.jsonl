When the late beloved R . F . Burke, former Appomattox county treasurer and bank president, was lad of nine years, he was stay ing with his grandparents, Mr. and William Blunt at Pleasant Hill in Nottaway county. The War Between The States was raging all around them., A stiff ekfrmish frmas waged right at them. As Federal soldiers ap proached, the slaves were ordered to take the horses down near the river bank and hide them. Young Mr. Burke went with them. On the way back to the house, they were met by some Yankeie soldiers. The soldiers badly fjrightenied both the slaves and the young white master. They seemed to pick on the latter, but he talked right up to them. Then his nose started to bled... .always when he got excit ed his nose would bleed. And the blood trickled down on his white shirt. Just fit that -moment la Iktndly Federal officer came up. He saw what was going on, and rescued the boy. He took him on his horse and rode him up to the house and soothed his ruffled feelings. But when his grandmother saw the blood on his shirt she thought he had been wounded...a fear that was allayed when his experience was related. Now.. . . the scene jumps to Ap pomattox . Years. . . . many years.  later, when M r.R.F.Burk became Appomattoxs most successful citizens, a man came.. a veteran of the Federal army, came to Appo mattox to see the scenes of the Surrender. He asked to spend the night in the Burke home.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

It is alleged that such proceedings as were carried on four years ago were very distasteful to many of the citizens of the county and for that reason the rank and file of voters are slow to express their choice for fear of the recurrence of hostile feeling.

Colonel Terrell being a candidate for what is called the organizations forces and Mr, Gannaway representing t h e antis. In this, like other county contests, there has been no issue and the fight hangs chiefly on personalities. In some quarters, the question of the short ballot issue has been in jected in which Mr. Gannaway ias declared himself as opposed to the short ballot, while no such statement has come from Mr. Terrell other than he is for the administration policies. As the short ballot, is an administra tion policy, however, it is regard ed that Mr. Terrell is for it, and su far, that is about the main is sue involved between the two candidates for that office.

The present i levies run from 1.80 to 1.95. The reduction is expected to cause a bolstering of confidence locally and will be warmly wel comed by tax payers. No con certed demand for a reduction had been made by citizens, but the supervisors and county of f a l s felt that the cut was in .ine with steps already taken by several other counties.
