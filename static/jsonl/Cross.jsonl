Jer. 523, he re belled against the king of Babylon. He relied upon the help of Egypt, but all that Egypt could do was to cause temporary interruption of the siege of Jerusalem. I. The Seige of Jerusalem vv. 1-3. 1. Time of vv. 1, 2. It began on the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiahs reign and -lasted about eighteen months. The tenth month according to the Jewish calendar corresponds to our December- January, as their calendar year began about the middle of March. The reason the exact time is given is that this was to be an event of great importance to the Jews in their exile. 2. The Method v. 1. Nebuchadnez zar came in person with a large army and encamped against Jerusalem and built forts against it round about. It is thought that siege walls were built, around the city, shotting it in. On the tops Of these walls forts were built from which missiles of destruction could be hurled by their engines of war against the city. With the city shut in its fall was only a question of time. 3. The Famine v. 3. Gelkie says It was speedily followed, as is always the case, with an outbreak of pesti lence. Food was well-nigh gone. There had long been no bread. Moth ers were at last driven to murder and eat their children. Tlie richest citi zens wandering about searching for scraps in the dunghills. Even outside the city the people were starving. There was no bread for the people of the land. It is estimated that one- third of the people of Jerusalem died of starvation. II. Zedekiahs Flight and Fate vv. 4-7. 1. The City was Broken Up v. 4. The Chaldeans had succeeded in mak ing an opening in the wall so large that they could make their way into the. city in spite of all that the He brews could do. Resistance was car ried on to the bitter end. 2. Zedekiahs Flight v. 4. The king with his men of war fled by night to ward the plain. His object, no doubt, was to cross the Jordan at Jericho and hide in the mountains east of Jordan. 3. Zedekiahs Fate vv. 5-7. 1 He was overtaken in the plains of Jericho v. 5. When his flight was. discovered the Chaldean army pursued and cap tured him. 2 He was brought to the king of Babylon at Riblah v. 6. Riblah was a town north of Damascus. It was the kings headquarters from which he directed his armies against Tyre and Jerusalem. Before Neb uchadnezzar, Zedekiah was tried as a criminal. 3 His.fate v. 7. His sons were slain in his sight his eyes were put out he was bound with fet ters of brass and they carried him to Babylon where he remained pris oner until the day of his death Jer. 5211. III. Jerusalem Destroyed vv. 8-10. The dismantling of the city was de layed a month, perhaps awaiting in structions from Nebuchadnezzar, who was at Riblah. 1. They Burnt the House of the Lord v. 9. This was the sacred temple built by Solomon with additions and modifications. Before burning it they plundered it of all its sacred contents. 2. Burnt the Kings House v. 9. This was doubtless the palace built by Solomon. 3. Burnt All the Houses of Jeru salem v. 9. The implication is that the common houses were left for he people v. 12. 4. They Broke Down the Walls of Jerusalem. The aim was to render the walls useless as a means of de fense. IV. The Disposition of tho People vv. 11, 12. 1. Carried Them Into Captivity v. 11. The people who were left In the city and those who had deserted to the Babylonians were carried to Baby lon all such as would be of use in Babylon. 2. The Poorest of the Land Were Left v. 12. The people who would not likely make any trouble were left as vine-dressers and husbandmen Doubtless they were looking forward to colonization by foreign peoples. The object in leaving these people was that the country might be ready for their coming.

BENNETT Nc unfinished nwers \u00f3r un won wars with God In Lukes Gospel, chapter 1428-82, Jesus illustrated the common problem of iinfinithedi business with two brief parables the parable of - an impulsive farmer who began to build an elaborate farm-building but did not finirii due to a lack of funds the parable of  a rash king who declared, war on a nation but did not win due to a tack of soldiers and military power. Unfinished business is the obvious problem in these parables, but what of the application to your life and mine? Traditionally, we have applied these parables to the Christian experience, saying that anyone who follows after Jesus Christ should first count the cost of that diseipleship. And this seems to be the obvious application since Jesus Him self said likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannotbe my disciple. However, there might be another application which isnt so obvious. When Jesus spoke these parables, the inevitability of the Cross loomed large on the horikon. Jesus has begun to tell the disciples of His impending suffering and death and no doubt, He knew what the immediate reaction would be from the disciples as they witnessed His death. They would be frightened, puzzl ed, disappointed, and dis illusioned, and ask ques tions lik\u00e9 Was Jesus really the Messiah, and if so, why did He die . . . Does this mean the actually death of God Himself? So. then, Jesus, who knew how these men would view the Cross, seems to be suggesting to them with these parables that there is no unfinished business,, no unfinished towers, and no unwon wars with God - the Cross would not mean the defeat of Gad and His Kingdom of right eousness.

And it isnt the shoveling itself tiiat is the problem. It is the way we go aboutit. -, Bates explained that most people-try to do too much too. quickly, too fast shoveling great mounds of snow and working very quickly. The combination of heavy snow and rapid working pace puts a great strain on our system---\u00e9s- pecially when we are not in condition. - The Blue Cross and Blue Shield fitness specialist re commended some precaution ary measures that can reduce th\u00e9 dangers associated with snow shoveling. 1. Use s short shovel, with a small scoop. 2. Lift small loads, not large ones dont fill the scoop , completely as you shovel. - 3. Warm-up slowly and then pace yourself stop to rest often-before you feel tired. 4. Dress warmly but dont overdo it too many layers of clothes work to trap body heat, placing still more strain on your cardivascular system. Bates emphasized th at people with high blood pressure suffer from angina, or are otherwise a high risk for heart attacks should not shovel snow under any circumstances. According to Bates, women are more -often more fit than men for snow shoveling. For one thing women have some natural protection against heart attack. Women often are in better physical condition than men, too, Bates continued, noting that- this is ini- part a  consequence of the work that  women do to keep their homes. Men are often disdain ful of such household activities as sweeping, mopping, and vacuuming because they dont fit with the traditional macho male image, he said. How ever such activities actually help strengthen the arm and back muscles, and the fact, that women are left to do these things contributes to the superior conditioning that many women enjoy. Men who want to get in shape would do well to pitch in and help with household chores especially if they spend their days sitting at - a desk. Bates concluded, We all need to become more physically fit. If youre not in shape this winter, start now to become more physically fit.

Cornys place was at the narre w crossing at Blank street, where n plat form of heavy planks had been built over the deep ditch of the subway works. At one end of the excavation was the hoisting engine house, and overhead the heavy wire cables carried the trolley car of earth or broken stone from the further end of the ditch to the dumping platform near the en gine. Beside the engineer was a window, and through this nperture he could see the boy with the flag at the cross ing, a long block away. He governed tue speed and the raising and lowering of the car according to the signal of that flag. Corny received his signals from the man who stood directly above the spot where the men were excavating, and who guided the swinging liox among the great pipes and drains aiul conduits which seemed to hang In a perfect network above the heads of the labor ers below, Besides keeping a sharp eye on the man, Corny was expected to be on the lookout for vehicles that wished to cross the ditch mid to allow none to cross while the loaded trolley wns run ning overbend. A bit of rock might fall from the car, or a horse might become frightened by the rattle of the trolley. The flagboy certainly enrned his half dollar. There was no time for sky larking, even had Corny been so in clined. But Maboney had been quite correct In his judgment of Cornys face life was altogether too serious to him for the flagboy to enjoy him self ns did other boys. When a person of fifteen feels the responsibility of forty-five resting on his shoulders skylarking Is a long way from his thoughts. The pitiable three dollars a week Mahoney allowed him was expected, with what Johhny could darn doing chores for the local store keepers and Ben could make selling papers to clothe, feed and house seven ravenously hungry, active growing boys and girls. It bad not always been so. Six months of trial and privation bad made a very old-fashioned boy Indeed of Cornelius Harney. The Ilarneys had only lived a year and a half In the eltv before the father died. They lntd come from  the old country, and after  hot man was taken, the mother pined more and more for the old English village where she had been born. She count do but little to help support the family, and soon the orphaned children raw her laid away also. Cornelius was the oldest boy. Mary, who was two years Ills senior, kept house for them and tried to keep the garments of the younger children de cently patched. Nobody seemed to want a boy of Cornelius age until be bad drawn the attention of Boss Ma honey at the underground works. Those three dollars looked big indeed to Corny until lie began to try to ap portion them outso much toward the rent, so much for food, and such a very little for clothing, and nothing at all for extras. Johnnys and Bens incomes were not to be depended upon, for they varied according to the num ber of errands Johnny could run and tile number of papers Ben sold. And to make sure of those three dol lars Corney had to be up at 6 every morning, rain or shine, warm or cold, and. be did not get back until ! at night. There certainly was no thought of play in the Ungboys mind.

McAdo was the name of the man who bad been flagging, and Corny knew it and trembled.  Hes no good, an Ive fired him. Mahoney declared, belligerently.

His own mother Mary, before he was born, sang a song of her own mak ing, so beautiful that it is still sung in Christian churches and loved the world around. - When Jesus died on the cross, two of the last seven sentences that came from his lips were quotations from the Psalms.

Kerosene, however, will not stand over seventy pounds unless a small quantity of water is taken into the cylinder with each charge. The customary man ner of doing this is to employ either a separate small carburetor for the water or a small valve attached to the regular carburetor.

Davidron, however, admitted that he was arrested late in November and taken into the St.- Nicholas building and waa sworn, and told the story he had just told. Then he was released. Gallagher was arrested before that. He said they had it down to black and white, and he had to tell all he knew. Mr. BrennenAre you to get a diamond watch for this? Oh, yes I guess so like the one I got from Dempsey. Captain BeckYqu were promised noth ing for coming here, were you? No, sir. J. H. Ford, a detective, swore I know Beatty, Gallagher and Davidson. On Dec. 1 1 heard a conversation between Beatty, Gallagher and Davidson, to which Beatty told abont the powders and .what they con tained. Gallagher said he believed if Dempsey was home the strike would be won, but Beatty said he thought not. I heard Gallager say Tom Brady first sug gested croton oil. On Dec. 4 1 overheard a talk between Gallagher and Beatty, which was about the same as the former one. Beatty said Turkish rhubarb end snuff was in tha powders and it was not necessary to tell the rest. Gallagher said he could take the powders and go west add break np some strike there, and told Beatty to go to Homestead next day and get the receipt if he had to pay five dollars, as there was money to it for both of them.  Louis Welters, steward of the restaurant to tbe Homestead mill, testified that he noticed unaccountable sickness soon after employing Gallagher as a cook. He said that to spite of the best of food he and his wife become very ill, and bad never fully recovered. He had several times seen  Beatty talking to Gallagher to tbe mill.
