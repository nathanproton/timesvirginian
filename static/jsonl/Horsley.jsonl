These questions have baffled historians, challenged de tectives, caused law students to burn the midnight oil  but most of allhave intrigued the public. For the last few years theres been a big to-do about the first Christ mas card and the subject has fas cinated many greeting card col lectors, art dealers, museum cura tors and a sizable portion of the American and British public. The earliest Christmas card on record, in the light of recent find ings, appears to be that of W. M. Egley, dated 1842. Discovered in a mass of skating prints by the Brit ish museum, it is indisputedly a Christmas card and seems to have been produced for general use. It resembles the early New Years cards of German origin with its va rious scenes enclosed in a half- gothic, half-rustic trelliswork and it depicts the Christmas pantomine Harlequin and Columbine, a pup pet booth, skaters and other scenes relating to the holiday season. Its sentiment reads A Merry Christ mas and A Happy New Year to You. Until the Egley card was discov ered, the first known Christmas card was, for years, tho to have been the one designecy J. C. Horsley RA for Sir Henry Cole in London in 1846 who wanted a card to send to his friends at Christ mas. Horsleys card was litho graphed by Jobbins of Warwick court and a thousand copies struck off.

R. Horsley published in another column in reference to a good roads maes meeting here next court day. Our roads are indeed in a deplorable condition and some system must be devised to improve them. We are inclined to favor the old system. It is true the court of Appeals in the Proflit case which went up from Louisa county, held in effect, that to require a citizen to work on the road was the imposition of a poll tax on said citizen and as the constitution only authorized, a poll-tax of one and a half dollars, all laws enacting the labor system were unconstitutional. We have never seen the full text of this de oision, but we are constrained to the belief that there is something in the Louisu law, peculiar to itself to justify such a finding by our appellate court. We know that such was the opiuion of our A tty for the Commonwealth nearly a year ugo and that at that time he filed an opinion with Judge Chris tian bolding this view and advising the court to enforce the old sys tem. At any rate the effort to enforce thiB system should be tried now and if there is complaint let a case be made up and taken to the new court of Appeals. This court has just reversed the decision of the old court in the ceV ebrated Mary Miller case. This de cision was rendered by the old court iu January 1892 and since that tim has cost the people of this State more than a quarter of a million of dollars. By the Mary Miller decis ion the old court took from Justices of the Peace, almost all of their criminal jurisdiction and forced the county courts to try even the most trivial ctises. By their reversal of this decision the new Democcratic court restored to the J. Ps. their jurisdiction, which will save to the taxpayers large sums of money annu ally. We believe if the road question was taken to the new court, the Proffit case would meet with the same fate as the Mary Milier case"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Horsley"], "snippet": "of Mr. J.
