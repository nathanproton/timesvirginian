Lawson Monday night reported to the Town Council that excavation for the two acre sewage lagoon is al most complete.

Skinney Wooldridge and Dick Bass said they had located a piece of land the Bledsoe property and that seller, S. L. Lawson, had named a reasonable price. They said they would need a four stall building, plus upstairs area, and that one of the four stalls could be used as a wash pit. Council requested that they obtain tentative plans and an idea of how much such a build ing will cost. Mrs. W. W. Burke appeared before Council to review the work done by the RAD Centenn ial subcommittee and the sub sequent development of Appo mattox Heritage, Incorporated. We feel we have a unique story to tell, she said, in des cribing the proposed Sound - Light production for the Sur render Grounds. In a Sound- Light production, there are no live characters, she explained, and no screen to watch. While the story is being told via tape recording, lights are turned on in various buildings, or field areas are lit to reenact historical events. She said that a contribution by Council now would make it poss ible to bring Dr. Gordon Graham here to draw up plans for the production and to work full time on a job that has become too big for the volunteer help given thus far. Graham, she said, would act as executive di rector, but would be under the direct control of the board of directors of Appomattox Heri tage, Inc. Among other things being done in the sound-light planning, she said, is a survey of motel and hotel accomodations in a thirty mile radius. Dr. Lawson said that success ful production at the Park will be one of the biggest boons to this town in the last 109 years.

And, from a terrorist attack in Beirut, Lebanon to a youth wool contest in Blacksburg, Va., stories involving Appomattox Countys people were chronicled for the 92nd year in the pages of the Times-Virginian news paper. Following are some glimpses of the year about to end, as gleaned from the front pages of the Times-Virginian The year began with stories detailing a state study to locate possible sites for a low-level nuclear dump in the Old Dominion. Appomat tox Countians learned in the Jan. 6 issue of the times-virginian that their county was one of 18 being considered for location of the dump site. The nuke-dump issue came up again in the Jan. 20 Times-VIrginian, when the Appomattox County Board of Supervisors stated publically that they were opposed to a dump site in the county. The Jan. 20 issue also carried a story on the opening of Brandy Ann Manufacturing company in the old Pamplin School building, which provided jobs for many Pamplin residents who were left jobless when the towns Amelia Garment factory burned in 1982. The Feb. 3 Times-Virginum noted that the local cable television system was being expanded, with 60,000 feet of able on hand and in the process of being installed. The following week readers learned that Neighborhood Watch programs were being started around tlie county in response to s rise in local burglaries. The Feb. 24 paper carried a story on Linda Ruhfs second-grade class at Appomattox Primary School, which sent messages of cheer to U.S. servicemen stationed aboard the U.S.S.Shreveport, off the coast ol Lebanon. The March 3 edition of the paper noted with sadness the death of Andy Scruggs, a beloved member of the community noted for his volunteer work with the local rescue squad and fire department. The first glimmerings of political activity in the county were apparent in the March 10 issue of the paper, when Commonwealths Attor ney W. Sam Kerr announced that he would not seek re-election in the November election, and incumbent County Supervisor Horace Coleman announced that he would seek re-election ,to the Clover Hill District seat. More hats were thrown into the local political ring the following week, when David Nash announced that he would oppose Coleman for the Clover Hill supervisors seat, Franklin Vaughan announced that he would seek re-election to the Stonewall Supervi sors seat, and local attorney Thomas W.
