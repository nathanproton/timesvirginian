H. Browning, and the heated words that ensued soon led to blows, sev eral of which were exchanged. A very few minutes after the difficulty, Field Smith, a well-known resident of Appomattox, denounced the sher iff, and another difficulty was nar rowly averted. Mr. Coleman has been sheriff of Appomattox county for a good many years. He will be opposed in his candidacy for re-election to the office spring after next by Mr. Frank W. McKinney. A gentleman from Appomattox who arrived in the city yesterday said to a reporter of the News that Mr. Coleman had stated to several parties since the political meeting on Thursday, that he was a candidate for the legislature as the floater from Appbmattox and Campbell. Mr. Coleman has been a staunch Democrat for many years, and his action has been a surprise to his many friends. On Friday Mr Coleman told a friend that he was iu the fight and I mean business. The editor of this paper was not present when the altercation between the sheriff and Mr. Browning took place nor when the sheriff announced himself an independent candidate for the House of Delegates, but from the leliable information we liather there seems to be little doubt that the report given of the affair by the News is correct, except that which is corrected by card is this issue."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Frank", "W", "McKinney"], "snippet": "after next by Mr. <mark>Frank</mark> <mark>W</mark>. <mark>McKinney</mark>.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Seldom has a death of a member of our community affected everyone so sadly as that of Mrs. Lelia McKin ney, wife of Mr. Frank W. McKin ney. The announcement of her death and its suddenness sent a shock through the entire community. On Monday last she was taken very ill at about 11 oclock at night, and the conditions being very alarming,riders were sent out in all directions for physicians. Drs. W. H. Abbitt and A. A. Rice were found and promptly responded to the summons. They did all that was possible to alleviate her sufferings and to tide her over the dangerous illness, but when the evening shades of Tuesday began to fall, Mrs McKinney passed away. The hour of her death was 5 oclock Many of her friends were telegraphed for from Lynchburg and Richmond and among those who came by the earliest train were Mr. and Mrs. Wal ter McKinney,Mrs. Poore, of Lynch burg, and Mr. Charles Peers, of Rich mond. The funeral services, which oc curred yesterday at 4 oclock, were conducted by Rev. E. M. Craig, as sisted by Rev. W. S. Royall. The re mains of the deceased were interred in the old family cemetery, just the rear of the house. A very large number of friends and relatives were present to witness the last sad rites. Mrs. McKinney was a native of Appomattox, having passed her life, until a few months ago, at OldAp- pomattox Court-House. She was a daughter of Mr. Geb. Peers, our pre sent county clerk. She was married only last May, and at the time of her death was thirty-three years of age. She was a member of the Presby terian church, and her character as a Christian and as a womanwas sfffih that it would be almost an intrusion to touch upon it. As her pastor, Mr. Craig, said, she never let a day pass without showing by some kindly j act the impress of Christs spirit ppon her."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Frank", "W"], "snippet": "ney, wife of Mr. <mark>Frank</mark> <mark>W</mark>.

The first to greet me on our ar rival at Hotel Appomattox was Rev. Mr. Craig, who iB to succeed our be loved pastor at Union. His beaming face and preposessing manners are living credentials of an  all-sufficient substitute, and I am satisfied that the little flock at Union will be more reconciled to the ex change, when they know him. We wire most cordially received, and nicely entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Smith, whose charming daughters added much to the enjoy ment of onr visit The table was bountifully spread with a variety of the most palatable food. Indeed I never enjoyed abetter meal. I met up with several old friends, and formed some pleasant acquaint ances, among whom were Mrs. Peers, Mr. Charlie Saekett, Dr. Kearney, Mr. and Mrs. Frank McKinney, and Dr. John Hamlet. Our visit to the T imes office was very much enjoyed. The press was quite a curiosity to us both, aud the thought of having seen the source from whence flows so much good sense, wit and humor is gratifying.

In nam ing George Lackland brings to my mind a little incident that occared -it Spotsylvania C. H. during our big fight there. We had been fighting three or four days with infantry un til Gen. Stnart relieved ns with Gen. facksons men and we went into camp on Saturday night. Bnt about wo hoars before day on Sunday morning were ordered to prepare two or three days rations, and by light we started and was marched ip to the Court House and the Hrick Church tbe Fourth Regiment vas dismounted and ordered iu sup port of the Sixth Virginia Cavalry which was fast being driven in our direction, and we had hardly started when some of the boys said Charge, and just here Maj. Wool- ridge, who was in command of tbe Fourth Virginia Regiment, lost hie leg. We ran these skirmishers back icross a branch and up a hill some five h indred yards, and just on top - f this hill a new rail fence ten rails and stake and rider. Right here we ooys haled and commenced looking for something to get behind for ight in front of us and in plain view was a double line of yanxee in- antry. Well, sir, they soon open ed on us and I tell you the splinters tlew. But we were not there long before a ball struck Sergeant John S. Nickolas on the counter cf his boot when he cried out, Lord haveTner ey on me! D------that trick toh Barbee take ni\u00e9 out, and we jump d up and started. I had thought up to this time that I was pretty id on a race, but John gained on me at at every jump. And in run ning down that hill there was a washout in which we found George Lackland and he asked us to please take him out and we assisted him to get out and we started again and he after us. The Third Regiment had been dismounted and marched to this branch in support of the Fourth and when I got there they told me t bat the boys had passed sometime, and I waited uutil our regiment was ordered in and then we started from there in pursuit of Sheridan, who was marchiDg on to Ri- hniond. do not suppose that m old friends could put up such a run now. Mr. Editor, when you think all the names from different sources have been obtained, please print the whole list giving every man his proper distinction, and then the ros ter will be in the proper shape for Mr. Ellis to put in the clerks office, and in the pioper shape for each member of old Co, K to keep also, and pleise send me a copy, which kindness I will greatly appreciate. My best love to all the boys. I would be delighted to see them. Respectfully, A. A. B a r b e e ."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["W"], "snippet": "My friend, Mr. D. <mark>W</mark>.

Some of the houses in this towi have been so crowded with visitor dining the summer that the house keepers are enjoying the though that the emptying process will sooi begin. Evidently Farmville it growing in favor as a summer re sort and with its location, lithii water and other advantages it de- strves to attract widespread atten tion. The more I know of othe sections of the State the more am  satisfied that the Southside is th home of physical comfort. O il tables are much better supplied our nights are never uncomiortab ly warm, we havent the mosquito, the water is soft and good even where and as far as our people, well we will let others sing theii praises. The melon fadure has produced contusion in the ranks of tin brothers in black. The happiest human being I ever saw was old Goliah, many years dead, with a water melon all his own. How we do miss the peaches. Can we not introduce the use of the canvass for the peach orchard as well as the tobacco beds? We used to find them in the fence cor ners and along the roadside, and and they were good. Whats wrong with nature? Or is the fault with man? That drinking fountain f r Main Street is yet non est, but the dis pensary is  doing bittiness at the old stand. Editor Hart carries his head somewhat higher since Supervisors honors rest on him. He hasnt an nounced, however, that he would stand lor the legislature next time The Presbyterians have been greatly pleased with the preaching of Rev. Mr. Hatcher, pastor of the Methodist church, during the month of August and while their pastor was on his vacation. I suppose before the gates close a large majority of the people of Farmville will have been to the Ex position. Mrs. Miller, of Pennsylvania, is a guest at Mrs. Berkleys. Mrs. Dr. Crute has been visiting friends in Charlotte. Miss Frank Jones, who has been with friends is Smithfield is at home ai Hampden Sidney again. At the recent meeting of the Jewelers of the State Mayor Blanton was made 1st Vice-president of the body. He is an accomplished occu- list as well as expert jeweler. The Hampden Sidney boys and the Normalites will soon be report ing for duty. This means another year gone, and to some of us that means much. Miss Stone, who has been writ ing to the Roanoke Times from here, has been saying some hand some things of Farmville. Captain Hunt has been so impor tuned not to resign from the com inand of the guards that the hope is entertained that he will not do BO. The new conservatory of music is opened for scholars. Prof. G. W. Walker, of Blacks burg, will make the opening- ad dress at Hampden Sidney this year. No pastor has yet been selected for College church. Farmville will be crowded with amusements for the coming season. But the new railroads are slow- a-coming. It must be interesting to some people just to project new enterprises and leave them in the air after the  hot air has been ex pended. The old-time farmers picnic was a great success. Tobacco still demands first claims on our cash and is sure to get it. A winsome weed is she. The Methodists are hoping to dedicate their new church building in the near future and when that is done they will have oue of the most attractive ho ises of worship in the Common weal lb and with the Nor mal contingent the congregation will be one of the most interesting. Rev. Mr. Hatcher preached a noble sermon on last Sunday, his text being,  Keep thy heart for out of it are the issues of life. Judge Laudon C.
