The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

At a largely attended mass-meet iufc  here Thrsday, T. J. Stratton was mado-ohairputg rod W. j. Trent secretary. Major J. W. Flood made the openin speech in favor of a reg ular monthly Meeting day for Un people of the Qopnty, and suggested that a bill be drawn fixing regular monthly- meeting days for the su pervisors Wad school board. This propQeftton was voted down, bnt a committee was raised for the pur- po e of devising a plan and some scheme for getting the soverigns to gether monthly. This committte is expected to report to a mass-meeting which will be bold next month. There are many advantages to be , derived from . a monthly conference of our farmers, and we would be glad to have them assemble here in the capacity of an institute or club. There will be but one more term of the old county court and some kind of permanent institution should be organized to take its plaoe. The same organization took up the road question and after much discussion it was practically decided to rpfer the whole matter to a com mittee composed of the present and new board of supervisors, the newly elected road commissioners and per haps the aid of the magistrates will pointed be sought in getting up a plan to be submitted to a mass-meeting whiob is to be called for January or Feb ruary court. The sense Of  meeting was evidently in favor of retaining the road machine, and the discussion developed the fact that the road machine had, greatly im proved the roads. There are many of otit- citizens, however, who claim that the present system does not pay enough attention to the roughplaces and it would be well for the com mittee to consider carefully this fea ture of the plan they will provide or the meeting will almost certainly amend it. It is said there are sev eral roads in Stonewall which have been neglected for years. Mr. How erton who spoke for the contract system said that  a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, nor a road no better than its worse mud- hole. Mr. Bristow in offering his motion to repeal the road law enact ed last spring Bpoke with earnestnsss to his resolution and spoke of the great advantages of the machine over the labor and contract system. Major Flood, Hon. W, H. Ligon and Dr, Bobertson addressed the meeting No vote was taken which fairly pre sented the issue between the machine and the contract system, and it looks now like the whole matter will be np again for decision at the next mass-meeting, with the chances in favor of the machine.
