Or was It Blair or Johnson? Mr. Grimm did not say. Didnt you anticipate any person al danger when you j entered ? he queried Instead. Werent you afraid I might shoot? No. There was a long silence. Mr. Grimm still sat with his elbows on his knees, staring at the vague white spotch which was Miss Thornes face and bare neck. One of her white arms hung at her side like a pallid serpent, and her hand was at rest on the seat of the couch. It seems, Miss Thorne, he said at length casually, that our paths of duty are inextricably tangled. Twice previously we have met under cir cumstances that were more than strange, and nowthis! Whatever In justice I may have done you In the past by my suspicions has, I hope, been forgiven and In each instance we were able to w6rk side by side to ward a conclusion. I am wondering now if this singular affair will take a similar course. He paused. Miss Thorne started to speak, but he silenced her with a Blight gesture of his hand. It is only fair to you to say that wethat Is, the Secret Servicehave learned many things about you, he resumed in the same casual tone. We have, through our foreign agents, traced you step by step from Rome to Washington. We know that you are, in a way, a representative of a sovereign of Europe we know that you were on a secret mission to the Spanish court, perhaps for this sover eign, and remained in Madrid for a month we know that from there you went to Paris, also on a secret mis sion-perhaps the sameand re mained there for three weeks we know that you met diplomatic agents of those governments later In London. We know all this we know the man ner of your coming to this country of your coming to Washington. But we dont know why you are here. Again she started to speak, and again he stopped her. We dont know your name, but that is of no consequence. We do know that In Spain you were Se\u00f1ora Cas- savant. In Paris Mademoiselle dAubl- non, in Londop Miss Jane Kellogg, and here Miss Isabel Thorne. We re alize that exigencies arise In your call ing, and mine, which make changes of name desirable, necessary even, and there is no criticism of that. Now as the representative of your govern mentrather a governmentyou have a right to be here, although unaccred ited you have a right to remain here as long as your acts are consistent with our laws you have a right to your secrets as long as they do not, directly 01 Indirectly, threaten the welfare of Oils country. Now, why are you here? He received no answer he expected none. After a moment he went on Admitting that you are a secret agent of Italy, admitting everything that you claim to be, you havent con vinced me that you are not the person who came here for the letters and cigarettes.

Ford has returned to Lynch burg from Richmond and Norfolk, where he secured a pardon for W. E. Turner, former ly of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, who has been in the penitentiary for three years. It seems that Turner was the victim of a conspiracy of his wife, who accused him of an assault on her daughter, for which he was sentenced In the Corporation Court of Norfolk to ten years in the penitentiary. After the trial his wife secured a divorce and married an Englishman. Affidavits were made showing that her people admitted that It was a job put up on Turner by his wife, and it was on the strength of these that he was pardoned.

Ellis, III. The reassessment conducted by the Board will be effective for 1982 real estate taxes. The general reassessment was called for by the Buckingham County Board of Supervisors, The last .general reassessment was conducted in 1976. Virginia Law requires reassessments to be con ducted every four years, but a reassessment may be delayed one or two years if desired by the Board of Supervisors. For the present cycle, the Board of Supervisors chose a five-year interval. State Law requires real estate to be assessed at its fair market value.  The Board of Supervisors decision to conduct a reassessment now was in fluenced by a State Depart ment of Taxation study. That study showed , the average real estate parcel was assessd at 78 of its estimated fair market value as of 1978. The study also indicated Some disparitylBWWeen the assessment or various Cate gories of real estate. During times of high inflation, it is expected that rapid changes in land values would increase the difference bet ween the assessed value and the actual fair market value. The Board of Supervisors has hired appraisers to assist the Board of Asses sors with the reassessment. The appraiser will visit every parcel in the County, make an initial estimate of its value, and present that information to the Board of Assessors foi its review.

This doesnt mean the textile and manu facturing business will stop, .there are more people to clothe, she says. The mens-wear market includ ing H5 years of age and over will increase by 15,000,000 by 1970. The womens-wear market 15 years or over is growing slightly faster than the mens market. The total increase is expected to be 18,000,- 000 by 1970. The market for the age group over 40 is expected to in crease somewhat faster than that for younger people. In Virginia, Miss Johnson says, the 1953 figures available indicate taht 9 to 10 of the spendable income was used on clothing the family. The middle of the road or median family con sisted of four members and spent 3175.97. This amount of money was seldom divided evenly among the members, but acording to then needsbased on activities and on growth. In 1954 the average price for wearing apparel has risen slightly, about 1 higher than a year ago. A few declines in prices of womens clothing are noted, restricted to items made of man-made fiber.

Mrs. Jonnson, familiar with many wild and remote lands, knows a lot about the Solomons. Shortly after her marriage to the late Martin Johnson, her husband I talked her into going to those islands  and her life there she describes with , much vividness in her latest book,   Bride in the Solomons. Houghton Miflin But getting back to the is land ladies. They are absolutely without lure, Mrs. Johnson declared as we chatted in her pleasant Park avenue offices. Judging by almost i any standard, they are entirely de-  ficient in pulchritude. Also they bathe so seldom that a young girl going around barefooted, which i they all do, looks as if she were j wearing puttees.    In the Solomons, Mrs. Johnson  continued, a woman has the value of a pigandthe pigs run wild. If some young man desires a damsel for his bride, he gives the chief a pig. The chief in turn presents the pig to the family of the bride-to-be. The family in turn provides a feast at which the pig is eaten. If the bridegroom wishes another bride, he gets hold of another pig. Sometimes the brides family gets a little up pity and demands cash in addition to the pig. That isnt hard since cash consists of shells and porpoise teeth. Speaking of pigs, Mrs. John son told me that they, as well as dogs, were introduced in the islands by Captain Cook. Boars break off their front teeth. The new one comes in curved and the more times it is broken off, the more it curls until sometimes there is . a beautiful double curv\u00e9.    Even young women in the Solo mons look old, Mrs. Johnson said. That isnt due entirely to the fact that there are no beauty parlors and nose-bobbing and face-lifting are unknown. Its  mostly because the women do all the work. The lord and master may condescend to lay out a garden, but it is the women of his household who do th\u00e9 plant ing and the harvesting. Also they do the cooking, baking, the hut building and other little chores. So  low is the estate of woman that a j mother isnt allowed to raise her  own son. The men have a big club- , house where women are not per mitted to enter. At an early age, I the son is taken to the clubhouse where he is taught to be a warrior. If his mother wants to see him, she ! must stand at a respectful distance 1 and call to him.   Tabuism applied even to Mrs. I Johnson. She was wild to look into I one of the head houses  the I plate where such trophies as human heads are stored. But she never got the chance. Or rather she didnt take the chance of indulging in so much as a peek. To have done so would have caused trouble  much trouble. In the first place, she j would have been killed. In the sec- i ond place, her husband would j have been killed. Then having made the start? the natives would keep right on until all white men within reach and probably a lot of natives were slain. Thus, vengeanceand a meat supply. Cannabalism, despite all attempts to stamp it out, still exists Mrs. Johnson averred. When things get too hot along the coast, the head hunters merely move to the mountains.    Mrs. Johnson, a native of Chanute, Kan., in her own words, was merely a  little country girl, when her husband induced her to go to the Solomons by picturing the ! islands as an earthly paradise, with I beautiful flowers, languid climate, I etc. She found the flowers all right I but many were poisonous. She also I found rats as big as rabbits, huge spiders and landcrabs that would nip off fingers. Along with snakes, humidity, torrential rains and jungle stink that cannot be de scribed. But Martin Johnson got what he went aftermotion pictures of head hunters. He made the mov ies and his wife made the stills, many of which are reproduced in j  Bride in the Solomons. Also Mrs.  Johnson became so proficient with  a rifle she shot dov.n cocoanuts."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Johnson"], "snippet": "ions, according to Osa <mark>Johnson</mark>.
