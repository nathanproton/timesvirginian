The American Institute for Social Service has named delegates to attenf the international housing congress hich Is to be held in Paris from Julj to November, end. the purpose of whlcl Is to arrive at the best plans for mak ing the homes of the working people more especially the poosqr classes more healthful, convenient and attract e without Imposing serious additional burdens on tbe occupants. It is ex pected that in this long continued con gress the whole subject, from tht standpoint of the working people, th landlord, the tenant, the philanthropist and the municipal and State govern ments, will be reviewed and consid ered. Much good should result tho world over from such deliberations. This subject is one to which the peo ple of this country should give special consideration. The working people of the United States live better than those of any other nation In the world, but so they should. They are better paid. The opportunities for general educa tion and refinement are within the each of a much larger proportion of the population than in any other coun try. The inducements for individual ambition are greater in this free, demo cratic land than in other parts of the world. Yet there is scope for great improvement in the domestic environ ments of a very large class of Ameri can working people, and it should be the business of all those who, through the obligations of special fortune or thoseof official position can do mucb to promote the social order, to glvo this subject attention. A little direction, given in the right spirit, will help amazingly those who have little art in helping themselves in the improvement of -the material aspects of home life. The matters of sanitation, cleanliness, order, furnish ings and decorations, both in the house and on the premises, can be greatly promoted through a measure of en couragement. These things do not necessarily make living more, expens ive, nor do they increase the burden? of home keeping. A house once in or der may be kept in order with but little daily attention.  But the greatest aid and incentive to better standards in the home Is hlghet standards in the municipality. A city that has well-paved and well-kept streets, good sidewalks, plentiful shade, fine parks, handsome boulevards and abundance of water at cheap rates, a perfect sewer system and a public- spirited administration will not only nspire civic and individual pride in the hearts of its residents, but it will also Invite the better classes in all tho walks of life.

Britton explained that Appomattox and other towns in the state are currently under suit by Fidelity Bank, which is contesting the state law which allows the towns to tax the bank franchise.

The permit was granted on the stipulation that Lawson pay the town ahy necessary funds for upgrading the town sewer system to treat additional sewage created by the apartment project, if it is determined that the plant can not handle the additional sewage at the time that the apartments are completed. If, on the other hand, the sewage plant can process the additional load created by the apartments when construction is complete.

We sent the town attorney, a mem ber 1 of the council arid the ser geant to the district office in Farm ville, Va. to ascertain the facts in the case and we find that there is no possible chance of getting the project started owing to a short age qi lreief. labor and the re quirement that 90 per cent of said ijibor must be taken from relief rolls, and further fact that soil erosion and conservation, reforest ation and re-habilitation projects have priority over WPA projects such as our sewer system in se curing labor. Therfore, not with standing the fact that the project has been approved it cannot be car ried out because of a shortage of labor. I want to assure you ftjr editor that the mayor has the int oiests of Appomattox at heart as much as any person living in the town, and is always willing and ready to co-operate to the fullest extent to that end.

Pluma grown in this section this season are superior to any I ever saw. Many of them are as large as the average apple and are as delici ous as they are large. If the land owners of this section are not en- conraged to pay more attention to fruit growing in the future then object lessons are of not muon im portance. I very much doubt that California can beat us on the plum lines. There is promise of a warm pri mary town election even in the warm weather of the  summer. There are some fifteen applicants for the town sergeantcy made va cant by the retirement of Sergeant Miller, and it is proposed to decide between them by a primary. The office is worth some 1,500 a year, rather a good pull at publio pap, the aspirants afe all popular and the race will be exciting from start to \u00e1nisb. Another suggestion is to do away with a town treasurer and have the sergeant to do tho work alohg with that of his own office. The charter says there must be a treasurer, but it does - not say that the sergeant may not be trea surer. The combination would sive them 800 a year to the town and in the management ol ones private business that amount saved would be reckoned as desirable. Still another suggestion is that a general manager be appointed to have charge of the street improve ments, the electric light system and the water and sewer should the town buy the last two.

We are n.t letting the outside world hear about ns, and this in my opinion, is of prime importance. Larger cities are advertising as never before in their histories, and if it is necessary with them places like Farmville can not afford to neglect if. Atlanta has been made on printers ink, and Jacksonville is feeding at th-j same trough. Des . inoines perhaps leads them all and results ts-ere have been far ahead of all exp ctations. And whats true of towns and cities is equally true of merchants. Wanamaker is now 72 and yet he advertises as though he was beginning a new business for he has new goods to sell day by day. There are no shop-worn goods on the shelves of merchants who advertise. Not spasmodically but regularly and intensely.
