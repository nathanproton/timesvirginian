Abbitt spoke before the House voted on the foreign aid authoriza tion bill and was critical of the program both from the standpoint of cost and worth to the security of America. The Virginian said he doubted if there has ever been a program in America which has had as much waste and inefficiency as the for eign aid program. The bill before the House, he said, authorizes expenditure of 3,- 242,333,000, a cut of 375,000,000 under the Senate-approved figure, and l,157i,667,000 under the Pres idents original request.
