They never dreamed that the Tavern they built at Clover Hill, in 1819, would become the museum of relics of a great peace for a nation re united after four years of bitter internacine war. Clover Hill Tavern is the oldest building at the Appomattox Court House National Military Park. It has just been restored and houses the National Park Service Museum . . . a museum now displaying as a late addition the famous Guillaume paint ing of the Surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee to Gen. U. S. Grant, April 7, 1865. Another new feature is an electric map, showing just where the great events of history occured here. Two brothers, Alexander and Lil bourne Patteson, opened a stage coach line from Lynchburg to Rich mond in 1811. At that time the im mediate area at what is now Old Appomattox Court House was a part of Prince Edward County, Appomat tox County not having been estab lished until 1845. In 1814 the Pat teson brothers purchased 206 acres laying near the north branch of the Appomattox River from one John B. Sadler. The land was valued at 157.89. In 1819 they built the Clover Hill Tavern, and the property zoomed to a value of 7,890. There is quite a story about these Patteson -brothers. A 208 page In formal History of the Virginia-Ken- tucky Pattesong in Illinois, Their Forbears and Their Kin by Ethel Marion Smith, traces the Patteson ancestry back to 1680. The first Pat teson entry in St. Peters Parish Reg ister in Eastern Virginia, shows that one Thomas Patteson came over from England in 1680 and settled on what is known as Roxbury Plan tation. Thomas Patteson had five sons Thomas, Edward, David, Alex ander and Geofrge, The next name to look for was Obfcdiah Patteson, who the St. Peters Parish Register says was born in 1750. His second son was named Littleberry . . . and father and son, Obediah and Little- berry took up land patents in this section in 1782. Records exist that show! that Obediah Patteson paid taxes on 800 acres of land in Camp bell County from 1782 through 1791. Littleberry Patteson was born in New Kent County in February, 1754, married in 1782 and died June 23, 1827. He fought in the Revo lutionary War. He is known to have paid taxes on land in Buckingham County from 1793 to 1814. He married Matilda Smith. Lilbourne and Alexander, build ers of Clover Hill Tavern, were sons of Littleberry Patteson. They owned Clover Hill Plantation, under a deed dated November 25, 1814. Alexander Patteson died in 1836, and his fam ily moved to Kentucky. Family rec ords show that the family was prom- ient. David Patteson of Chesterfield, Jonathan of Lunenburg, and Charles of Buckingham represented their re spective counties in the Virginia Convention of 1788 to ratify the United States Constitution. A stage coach line was a great thing 150 years ago. Clover Hill Tavern was a grand conception at a time when Americans were fan ning out from the Atlantic Coast and moving Westward. The Clover Hill Tavern remained in the hands of the Patteson family until Aug ust 8, 1839, when it passed to John Raine. It was transferred to Hugh Raine in 1842 for the sum of 3,- 200, and again passed to Samuel McDearmon in 1845. McDearmon, a great leader in the early growth of this section and one of the top citizens of his time, added many outbuildings and improvements to the Tavern. However, he sold the property to Samuel Glover in 1854. The foundation lines of this store are today readily apparent as a de pression in the ground between the Tavern and the Ferguson home, re cently used as Park Service office. About the year 1859, Glover transferred his holdings to Wilson Hix. The holdings at that time con sisted of lots 16 and 17 in the vil lage of Appomattox Court House and contained the Tavern and its outbuildings. Hix operated the prop erty as a hotel all through the Civil War period. It was yvritten up in the New York Hearld in April, 1865. It was referred to as Glenns Hotel and was used as the office of the paroling officer. Gen. Sharpe. In 1880, it was transferred from the estate of Wilson Hix to Edward G. Hix and included lots 11, 17, 18 and part of lot 16 in the village. The ownership continued to change hands until finally resting in the Continued on Page Eight"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Parish"], "snippet": "entry in St. Peters <mark>Parish</mark> Reg ister in Eastern"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Parish"], "snippet": "entry in St. Peters <mark>Parish</mark> Reg ister in Eastern"}], "text_match": 578730123365187705, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "1108091338752", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "578730123365187705", "tokens_matched": 1, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

The man they described  as the simple parish priest was not moved by the onslaught. He took j the position that the new sect i should not be tolerated. He realized that prominent men in his own fold were among the leaders, and some of them, when brought face to face with the ultimatum of Pius X.. recanted, while others left the church. The effect of this encyclical has been felt in all Europe and in the United States. It came like a bomb. On becoming supreme pontiff there j was of course some real curiosity shown as to the attitude of Pius X. in his relations with the Quirinal. it was flgured in some quarters that the new pontiff was kindly disposed to ward the Italian government, and that  as a result the breach which was i made in the Porta Pia and by which was effected the overthrow of the temporal power of the Pope back in  1870 would be filled in and all differ ences between the Vatican and Quiri nal settled amicably, but Pius X. fol lowed the exampU et by Pio Nono and Leo XIII. He refused to recognize the law of guarantees which had been passed by the Senate and chamber of the Italian Parliament on May 13, 1871, that con cerned the prerogatives of the Holy See and the relations between church and state in the kingdom of Italy. Among the stipulations were The Popes person to be sacred and in- 1 violable, and he be treated with royal honors and that he be given an an nual endowment of 3,225,000 lire, or 022,425, to cover all the needs of the Holy See. This law was not recog nized by Pio Nono or by Leo XIII., and the endowment has been accumu lating annually, it Is said, since the law was passed. Pius X. did not draw on the funds, and he did not take advantage of the assurances of military protection. He shut himself up in the Vatican after the example of his two predecessors and remained a voluntary prisoner.

The building of the Tidewater railroa 1 through that country has given a new life-thrill to it. Real estate values have greatly increased and the timber interests of the county are attracting wide spread attention. Victoria, the terminous of a division of the road, is build ing rapidly and promises to be a town of considerable size and im portance. There is no good that can come to Lunenburg that Farm ville will not rejoice in. There 117 students at Hampden Sidney this session as against 72 two years ago and 82 last year. The number cf new students is 79 as against 22 two years ago and 43 last year. Of the whole numbi r enrolo 1 this year Virginia sends 82 West Virginia 2, Tennessee New Jersey, 2, while Florida, Ill inois, Maryland, Mississippi and North Carolina send one each, and Japan sends one. This is dr,ing well and Richmond should let well enough alona. A library for Farmville may be reckoned among the assured facts. The mothers of our town are be hind the movement and that means it must go. At a recent public meeting which was held in the in terest of the project representative business men made enthusiastic speeches in its. advocacy and noth ing remains but to get the books and go to reading. McCauly says, reading makes a full man so that we will have two pl aces at which our people may get fu ll li brary and dispensary. The Normal girls not only en joy the splendid faculty of 26 of gifted men and women. Mrs. Brooks, the accomplished lady mat ron, who has been kept from the school for sometime, is on duty again. The Episcopalians o 1 our town are still without a rector, though the pulpit of the church has been well filled of late. Mr. Garnett, our new postmaster begins to look very much at home in the new position. With  pleas ant duties to perform and a 2000 salary to draw with unvarying reg ularity most of us would feel com fortable in the cozy official nest. With one exception, that of star route mail carriers, Uncle Sam is a good pay master. The old gentle man is especially kind in his deal ings with his day laborers, who work only 8 hours and have 16 for play and sleep. I have always thought that was ideal division of the day. Farmers who rise at 3 a m and retire at 8 p m wont agree with me however. The health of Mrs. Tom Clark is far from good, and she may go to a sanitarium near Asheville, N. C. for treatment. Ur. J, W. Gills has elaborately furnished offices over the store room of Messrs. Verser  Son. He is gaining in popular favor day by day, and is not only learned in his profession but knows how to meet with the people. A cheerful, com panionable, family physician is better than physic. Mr. Vernon Paulette went west not in search of a wife, but he found one and telegraphed the fact to his Farmville friends. A happy greeting awaits them on their ecin- ing to the old home, and the old friends. Our merchants and milliners are stocked up for spring and summer and stand waiting for customers. Mrs. R. S. Paulette and sister, Mrs. Bettie Venable, of Hampden Sidney, have been visiting in Wash- ngtrn and Baltimore. Mrs. Dr. Messenger is on a visit to home folks in Iowa. Mrs. Wallace Burnette, of Wash ington, vho has been with us re gaining her strength after practical illness, will return to her home ou the 1st of April. Prospective sweet girl graduates are already excited over diplomas, flowerB, addresses, white dresses and farewells. May their brightest hopes be all realize l.

The f a m i l y is enormously impor tant in many ways. There is room to speak of only one of them. Students of personality have found a new but simple name for something that every one ought to have, but not every one does have it is called the  we-feeling. The lone-wolf type of person never really thinks we. His mind divides the world into two armed camps on the one side is I and on the other side is every one else. He goes through life assuming that nobody is for him, nobody is with him, and he in turn is for no body and with nobody. His  hand is against every man, as the Bible says. Even if he teams up with others for a while, he will double- cross them if he thinks he will make something out of it. He is your typical criminal, anti-social as teachers and sociologists call him.    What It Means to Grow Up fH IL D R E N usually begin l i f e  without m u c h , we-feeling, if any. They dont naturally share their toys or their dinners or any thing else. They grab all they can and they dont like to be grabbed from. The process of growing up really growing up, not merely get ting older and biggeris a process ef developing a healthy we-feeling. Nearly every one develops this to some extent, of course but when some people say  we they dont mean very many. We have all heard of the man who prayed Lord, bless me and my wife, my son John and his wife. Us four, no more. Amen! He doesnt make a very good citizen. But as the  we -circle grows wider and wider we get a more and more publie-spirited and service- minded citizen, till at the high point of the we-feeling we see a man like St. Paul who calls himself a debtor to all men, or like John Wesley who said, The world is my parish, or a modern inter national citizen and statesman such as John R.

He had done this quietly, had uot preached politics during the 92 campaign, but suspicion was excited by something Mugwumpian in his appearance. An investigation was held and the startling truth came out. Of course there was trouble. Many of the young pastors parish ioners refused to contribute to his support, and others reproached him. Mr. Ephraim Morris, a woolen man ufacturer, is one of the principal financial pillars of this church, his contribution beiug one-third of the total annual expenses. Mr. Morris says of this matter I mistrusted from Mr. Boyds application that he was not a Re publican and cautioned the commit tee against hiring him, saying that I would not contribute to the support of a Democrat but they were all wise and had their way. I gave tbem fair warning and they must take the consequences. I went to Mr. Boyd and he acknwledged that he voted for Mr. Clevelaud. I am a woolen manufacturer.

He has a right to put his money where he thinks it will do the most good, but is he not going too far in con cluding that Mr. Boyd is a Demo crat merely because he voted for Mr. Clevelaud iu 1892 ? Would it not be better to follow the example of ex-President Harrison, who has urged his neighbors to vote for a candidate for Mayor of Indianopolis who did just what the Rev. Mr. Boyd did in 1892 ? Mr. Harrison regards this bolter as a Republican in 1895, in spite of the slip three years ago. Mr. Harrison will go to the polls and cast his ballot for the man who scratched him and voted for his opponent. We think this is a good example, good politics, and good morals.
