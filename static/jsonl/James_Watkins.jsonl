The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Mr. Thornhills remarks made a good impressiou, and he was the re cipient of congratulations upon his peech. Messrs. F. C. Moon and Ednt. W. Hubard, ou the part of Bucking ham, made short speeches seconding the nomination. At the conclusion of these speech es Mr. Paul Pettit moved that the nomination be made by acclamation, which was adopted, and the chair appointed Messrs. Gray, Thornhill, and Hubard to iuform Mr. Flood of his nomination, and to present him to the convention. Mr. Flood accepted the nomina tion in a speech of twenty minutes, which aroused much enthusiasm. He assured the peopie of his appie- fiaaou of the honor conferred, and of their endorsement and loyalty, to him and his public acts. He spoke earnestly of the faithful service to the laboring people of Virginia ren dered by Senator Martin, aud of the light he made for him in the Demo cratic caucus six years ago, assuring the Democracy of Virginia that, if- they would lay the mantle of the seuatorship upon Mr. Martin at that time, the Democracy of the Old Do minion would approve their action. Mr. Flood referred to the large ma jority of counties having gone for Senator Martin as proving the truth of his prediction, and said that Mr. Martin would be renominated by a four-fifths majority. At the con clusion of his speech he was pre sented wit-h a bouquet of beautiful flowers. Mr. F. 0. Moon offered the follow ing resolutions, which weie unani mously adopted Resolved, That the course of Hon. T. S. Martin, United States Senator, is fully endorsed and approved and the nomiuee of this convention is in structed to vote for and support Him for re-election to that position. . 2d, That the tiominee of this con vention is instructed to vote for and support Hon. George J. Hundley for re-electiou as Judge of this judicial circuit. Mr. W. W. Haskins said that he was instructed by the Maysville-dis- trict meeting to bring up the ques tion of moving the courthouse aud the nominee was instructed to op pose any movement looking to the removal of the courthouse. The senatorial convention then adjourned, and the house conven tion, composed of delegates from Buckingham and Cumberland, as sembled for the purpose of nomi nating a candidate for the House of Delegates. Dr. Pratt and Mr. Haskins were retained as chairman and secretary, respectively, of the convention.  W. M. Smith, of Cumberland, and F. C. Moon, of Buckingham, were appotiled a committee on creden tials, who reported the following delegates present and entitled to scats in the cony.epjbj.Qn t CumberlandW. if. South, H. D. Woodson. H. K. Adams, E. B. Davis, A. B. Armstrong, and J. W. Adams. BuckinghamWe are nnable to give the names of these delegates. F. C. Moon uommated Hon. E. W. Ilubar.t for delegate to the General Assembly from tjiis district, com posed of Buckingham an,d Cumber land counties, Mr. W. M. Smith, of Cumberland, in a few well chosen remarks, sec onded the nomination. Mr. John W. Adams moved that it be made by acclamation, which was done with a whoop. Sfr. Hubard was informed of his nonuuatiQQ, and was presented to the convention for a speech. Mr. Hubard made onj ?fp t his h.ap-i py speeches, full of logic and rea-! sou. He was severe on independ ents, and promised that the flag of Democracy should not trail in the dust, aud predicted a great victory fojt tjie party at the general election. He appealed ty his hearers with much force io si an cl by fthe nomi nees, saying it was not now afight, of Flood and Hubard, but a fight for the supremacy of Democratic"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Watkins", "James"], "snippet": "of these delegates.

It was a case of rain outside and Flood inside yesterday, and a gen eral all-round April-fool for those who attended the Police Court in expectation that a result would be reached in the cause of Senator H. D. Flood, who is charged with an assault upon Senator W. M. Flana gan, of Powhatan. The difficulty between the sena tors occurred during the closing days of the legislative session, and the trial was set for to-day from an examination held early m the past month. At an early hour yesterday morn ing, men began to arrive, and at 10 oclock the court-room was crowded to its utmost capacity, for all thought that the much-discussed case would be finally determined. It was a little after 10 oclock when Justice Crutchfield called the case of H. D. Flood,and immediately the hum and buzz of the expectant throng caused Sergeant Thomas to rap vigorously for order. In the row of seats reserved for the attorneys sat Commonwealths- Attorney Harry Smith, and neur him sat Senator Flanagan, who was not represented by any assistant in the prosecution. General Edgar Allan, who was in the court in the former hearing was not present, and Judge Waddill, another friend of Mr. Flanagan was also absent. Senator Flood occupied a chair between Senator Conway R. Sands and Mr. Charles V. Meredith his counsel. Justice Crutchfield called the following witnesses Malcolm A. Coles, H. L. Maynard, 6. T. Snead, F. B. Watkins, Dr. Pierce, Dr. Jeffries, Dr. Michaux, O. T. Crump, James R. Werth, Morris Parr, Mor ris Evws, Major Robert Stiles, Frank Perkins, and Norman Ran dolph. He then announced that a number of the witnesses had not responded to their names, and the list was recalled. MR. EVANS ABSENT. Mr. Flanagan had then come in side the rail just before the Justice. He stated that Mr. Morris Evans, was not present. Mr. Smith asked Mr. Flanagan if he thought they could get along without Mr. Evans, and Mr. Flana gan replied that he considered Mr. Evans one of the most important of all the witnesses. It then became apparent that the case would have again to be post poned. Mr. Evans lives in Powha tan and was expected on the Alle ghany road from Columbia this morning. Justice Crutchfield had the railroad office telephoned to and found that the train had ar rive on time. It was then suggested that possibly Mr. Evans had been unable to reach the railroad on ac count of the high water in the river near Columbia. Justice Crutchfield announced that he was very sorry to be com pelled to again continue the case, as the witnesses were many of them, brought from some distance, and that the expense to the state was large. Mr. Smith here jocularly remarked that as many of the witnesses were members of the Legislature, they were also of course opposed to in creasing the criminal expenses of the State."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Watkins", "James"], "snippet": "T.
