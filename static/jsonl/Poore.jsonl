There was au unusually large at tendance of the sovereigns from every part of the county on last Thursday, the regular term of the County Court. Mauy of them were doubtless attracted by the wide spread interest in the trial of the negroes George Flowers aud Charles Robertson who had been indicted aud imprisoned for the murder of Bob Boler near Spout Spring, on the uight of the 4th of January last. The parties indicted and the import ant witnesses had all made fiatly contradictory statements and an im penetrable mystery seemed to overhang the tragedy. There bad been a negro frolic and dance, the parliciputs, male and female,- be coming uproarious from whiskey. On the way home Bob Boler, Letitia Carson, George Flowers aud Charles Robertson were walking together apart from the othei s. A scuffle en sued between George Flowers and Bob Boler they were separated aud the puny walked on a few paces when pistol shots were heard and Bob Boler fell to the ground mort ally wounded, ana his dead body was left in the middle of the road.

The case occupied two days, and on Friday alternoou the jury brought in a ver dict of guilty and awarded the ac cused tea years in the peuitentiary. The counsel for the Commonwealth demanded only a verdict for murder iu the second decree, for which the punishment is confinement in the penitentiary admitting to the jury that they were unable to establish the ingredient of premeditation necessary - to elevate the homicide to murder iu the first degree.

Seldom has a death of a member of our community affected everyone so sadly as that of Mrs. Lelia McKin ney, wife of Mr. Frank W. McKin ney. The announcement of her death and its suddenness sent a shock through the entire community. On Monday last she was taken very ill at about 11 oclock at night, and the conditions being very alarming,riders were sent out in all directions for physicians. Drs. W. H. Abbitt and A. A. Rice were found and promptly responded to the summons. They did all that was possible to alleviate her sufferings and to tide her over the dangerous illness, but when the evening shades of Tuesday began to fall, Mrs McKinney passed away. The hour of her death was 5 oclock Many of her friends were telegraphed for from Lynchburg and Richmond and among those who came by the earliest train were Mr. and Mrs. Wal ter McKinney,Mrs. Poore, of Lynch burg, and Mr. Charles Peers, of Rich mond. The funeral services, which oc curred yesterday at 4 oclock, were conducted by Rev. E. M. Craig, as sisted by Rev. W. S. Royall. The re mains of the deceased were interred in the old family cemetery, just the rear of the house. A very large number of friends and relatives were present to witness the last sad rites. Mrs. McKinney was a native of Appomattox, having passed her life, until a few months ago, at OldAp- pomattox Court-House. She was a daughter of Mr. Geb. Peers, our pre sent county clerk. She was married only last May, and at the time of her death was thirty-three years of age. She was a member of the Presby terian church, and her character as a Christian and as a womanwas sfffih that it would be almost an intrusion to touch upon it.

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D.

Atwood, announcing that on Monday, Jan.. 1st there Would be a reception at their lome, which is known by the pretty name qf Cherwood. Auspicious, was the weather not a clond to mar the aznre pros pect of the heavens, and jnst enough frost in the air to add a zest and relish to-living. Each train, aa it pulled Into the station, left be hind its bevy of merry yonng people, and the village for a time assumed the airs and importance of a metrop olis. - Richmond, Lynchburg, Farm ville, Bhrkeville and Pamplin City, contributed to swell the crowd. By 9 oclock Cherwood was filled with the most beautiful and attract ive . gathering that has - ever a dis tinguished the social life of Appomat tox. The house was brilliantly illu minated and gracefully decorated, and it would require the pen and dis- criptive talent of a superhuman power to describe the exquisite toilets of jbe occasion. The yonng ladies in their beautiful -and varied oos tomes and the chivalry with their black evening suits and glossy white sfiift fronts made a pleasing and agreeable contrast as they sauntered in and out of the elegant apartments. Mrs. J. R. Atwood received in a cream brocade satin, point desprit lace and diamond ornaments. She was assisted by Mrs. Martin Harvey, Mrs. T. A. Woodson, Mrs. A. B. Da vis and Mrs. J. L. Chernault.

Harvey, and J. Mahone Miles. At eleven oclock refreshments were served and the table fairly groaned beneath, its weight of deli cacies. In the centre of the same was an immense pyramid, composed, of every frnit imaginable, and ar ranged so artistically that one might well have deemed it a picture. The feast included the fairest products of Summer and the daintiest morsels of Winter. Mr. E. Wiley Taylor, with his comic songs ana splendid imperson ations contributed much to- the en joyment of the gnests."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Poore"], "snippet": "Flood, Col. R.
