The steel jacket bullet struck Mr. Sale about eight inches below the left thigh and ranged in a zig-zag course around his hip. An X-ray negative, which was developed this forenoon, disclosed the fact that the bullet missed the thigh and hip hones and its location was re vealed, making its removal possible by a slight operation.
