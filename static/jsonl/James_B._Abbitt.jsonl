Flood to suc ceed himself as Senator from this district, iu a speech which was well received, by the audience, and which elicited much applause, showing plainly that the audience endorsed his eulogistic remarks on Mr. Flood and his record as a representative. Mr. Gray is a pleasant speaker, aud his remarks were timely and highly appreciative. Mr, A. B. Thornhill, of Appomat tox, in a beautiful speech, seconded the nomination of Mr. Flood. He referred to the magnanimity with which Mr. Flood refused the certifi cate of election to Congress in 1896, and presented figures showing that iie received 4,000 more votes than diu Mr. Tucker in 1894, and 6,000 more than did Mr. Quarles in 1898. Mr. Thornhills remarks made a good impressiou, and he was the re cipient of congratulations upon his peech. Messrs. F. C. Moon and Ednt. W.

At the conclusion of these speech es Mr. Paul Pettit moved that the nomination be made by acclamation, which was adopted, and the chair appointed Messrs.

Mr. Flood accepted the nomina tion in a speech of twenty minutes, which aroused much enthusiasm. He assured the peopie of his appie- fiaaou of the honor conferred, and of their endorsement and loyalty, to him and his public acts. He spoke earnestly of the faithful service to the laboring people of Virginia ren dered by Senator Martin, aud of the light he made for him in the Demo cratic caucus six years ago, assuring the Democracy of Virginia that, if- they would lay the mantle of the seuatorship upon Mr. Martin at that time, the Democracy of the Old Do minion would approve their action. Mr. Flood referred to the large ma jority of counties having gone for Senator Martin as proving the truth of his prediction, and said that Mr. Martin would be renominated by a four-fifths majority. At the con clusion of his speech he was pre sented wit-h a bouquet of beautiful flowers. Mr. F. 0. Moon offered the follow ing resolutions, which weie unani mously adopted Resolved, That the course of Hon. T. S. Martin, United States Senator, is fully endorsed and approved and the nomiuee of this convention is in structed to vote for and support Him for re-election to that position. . 2d, That the tiominee of this con vention is instructed to vote for and support Hon.
