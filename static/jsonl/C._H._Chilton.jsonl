Mr. Chilton was put in the field by the leading Re publicans of Appomattox county and if elected, he will act in the Legisla ture of Virginia not with the temo- cratic party, for he would not be permitted to enter its caucus, but with the Republican party and their allies, the Independents. Mr. Chilton, who is the writer ot the circular to which we refer, al ludes to bossism, ring rule, machine politics, corrupt election work, fraud and deception practised by the po litical tricksters in Appomattox county. We simply desire to say that there is no foundation in truth for any such charges. It is very easy to make a broad assertion of fraud anywhere. The Republican party has been indulging hi such charges against the Democratic party ever since they were whipped from power and the charge made by Mr. Chilton is but a rehash of the charges heretofore made by the Re puhlicaus. ilossism is a stale argument of the outs agaiust the ins, When Mr. C. H. Chilton was one of the ins, he was perfectly willing to submit to the kind of bossism winch he now decries and of all the people iu Appomattox county who have as sent bled at Democratic political meetings there was no louder claeker than C. H. Chilton. Of all the Democratic following of the county, there was no man in it so bitter and abusive of Republicans and1 Inde pendents and Populists as C. H. Chilton was and it was .not until he realized the fact that a number of the prominent member. of the Democratic party in the county were opposed to his re-ap pointment to the position of Super intendent ol schools of the county, hat he discovered, all of a sudden, hat Appomattox was a county of cliques aud bosses. It will he urged in Mr. Chiltons behalf that jieople who are opposed to the present election law should vote for him. This election law was enacted by the Legislature of Virginia at the session of 93 and 94. and went into operation for the first time at the Congressional election of 94  at that time, the Democratic party had no warmer supporter than Mr. C. H. Chilton and the present election law no stronger upholder than be nor from that time to his removal from the office of Superin tendent of schools in 97 was he ever beard to raise his voice against this election law. Who then can believe that his position in regard to it now is due to anything but a de sire to make cheap and false political capital for himself.

With a library of more than 5,000 volumes, audio - visual equipment and a growing guid ance program, the school has a bright future. From time to time salaries were discussed. In 1S72 the County Board adopted a salary sohedule A teacher holding a full certi ficate to receive 35 per month. A teacher holding an Inter mediate certificate to receive 25 per month. A teacher holding a Primary certificate to receive 20 per month. Teachers who had no certifi cate received less than 20. Mr. Chilton, as have other county superintendent, made a strong effort to help the teachers im prove their professional prepa ration. At the beginning of the school system in our county our efficient County Superintendent, Capt. C. H. Chilton, organized a County Teachers Institute, which met under a constitution and by-laws adopted by the soc iety for instruction in pedagogics regularly every month. The pro- meter of all school work found here a wide and inviting field. Captain Chilton did a good Work in this direction. Textbooks w e r e regularly studied to recite in these teach ers meetings in connection with recitations on theory and prac tice of teaching. Young teachers found aid and stimulus to their work. The more experienced be- oame more deeply impressed with the dignity, importanoe and responsibility of their avo cation. None but madmen and fools could ever aim to suppress such a helpful institution and adjunct to our admirable sys tem of free education. Gradually Capt. Chilton less ened the number of meetings, unfit an annual Institute was all that necessity seem to him to require. Even then steps to re quire teachers to attend had to be taken. As toe years passed a committee made up of the sup erintendent and teachers plann ed the Institute. The board was foresighted enough to recognize the value to be derived from the Virginia Journal, so in 1907 it was sent to each teacher for six months at the boards expense. The board did this on other occasion also. It was agreed to try to induce all the teachers who could do so to attend the Teach ers Meeting in Roanoke, Octo ber 5, 1907, and to receive their usual pay during the time lost from school.  Many teachers, maybe all, had to go to the Court House each year to take examinations for two days. Those examina tions were far different from what most of us would give to day. The Board granted a 2.50 per month raise in salary to those who attended the State Normals Summer School. The early schools were heated by fireplaces if heated at all.

The first County Superintendent of Schools was C. H. Chilton, 1870- 1881. He was succeeded by J. B. Bristow, who continued in office un til 1885.

Burke, 1926 to date, The first public school house built with county funds was erected at Hurtsville. Other school structures were added as fast as funds from school taxes made these accomoda tions possible. Mr. N. R. Featherston, in his his tory of Appomattox County, re ports that the school term in the early days of the system was five months. Teachers average monthly salary was 25.00. In 1908, Professor Lindsay Craw ley was apointed principal of the high school at Appomattox. The frame building housing the high school stood on the lot where the present T. W.

The Richmond Dispatch publish es the following extract from a let ter from its Apponiatiox correspond ent, of dale September 7th 1 saw iu your correspondence from Pamplius yesterday a statement that C. H. Chiiti n, of this county, is the Tyler Democratic candidate tor the legislature to represent this county and Campbell i had for merly seen a stateuieut in your paper in a letter from Concord to the ef fect that Mr. Chilton was uomiua- t d at a muss-meetiug held at Con- coid, at which 362 voters were pres ent in person or by proxy. 1 have intended for some time to correct the statement contained iu the Concord letter, but not having been present at that meeting, 1 had to wait until J could get my facts accurately, which I give you as fol lows  The meeting was called by people who have for years antagonized the Democratic party. All persons, ir respective of political parties, who favored Governor Tylers election to the United Stater Senate were invi ted to participate in it. It was not a meeting iu the form of a conven tion or one iu u inch the people ton Id be represented by delegates, bufc-was called as a muss meeting. There .ere presett by actual count twenty-nine voters,, twenty-three of whom were from Appomattox and six from Campbell. Turn not post ed as toChe politics of all the Camp bell participants, but I am very fa miliar with the politics of those who attended the meeting from Appo mattox. Only one of themviz., Mr. L. A- Williams, a brother-in-law of Mr. C. H. Chiltonshas been considered a Democrat for the past four years. Some of the most prom inent figures in it were W. C. Frank lin, county chairman of the Repub lican party of Appomattox, who has time and again been the Republican candidate for various offices H. E. Gilliam, a leading Republican F. B. .ones, T. H. A. Cheatham, C. B. Blox ton, and Hut Ferguson colored other prominent Republicans. In justice to Hut, it should be stated that when the resolution was passed by themeeting declaring that no money should be used in the interest of tne nominee, he left in disgust. The meeting in no sense repre sents any DemocVatic sentiment iu Appomattox county. There hasj bean no split in the Democratic par ty here, and 1 do not believe there has been or will be any in Campbell, but I know the Democrats of our county are solid for the regular nom ine, Mr. J. R. Horsley. We think it an injustice not only to our nominee but to our people to characterize a meeting gotten up and dominated by leading Republi- eani as a Democratic meeting, when the other man they nominated if, by any mishap, he should be elected, would not be admitted into a Dem ocratic CUUCU8, Mr. Chilton himself has not voted the Democratic ticket for at least four years, and probably longer. M r. J. R. Horsley was nominated by a Democratic mass-meeting which was the largest meetiug of the kind held in this county in the recollect ion of its oldest inhabitants. It. was fully representative of the wishes of the party. It was held after due uotice and after an active cau vass of the county by Mr, Horsleys fiiends and the friends of I is opponent,"}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["C", "H", "Chilton"], "snippet": "a brother-in-law of Mr. <mark>C</mark>. <mark>H</mark>. <mark>Chilton</mark>shas been considered a Democrat"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["C", "H", "Chilton"], "snippet": "a brother-in-law of Mr. <mark>C</mark>. <mark>H</mark>. <mark>Chilton</mark>shas been considered a Democrat"}], "text_match": 1736172785157275769, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "3315687620608", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "1736172785157275769", "tokens_matched": 3, "typo_prefix_score": 1}}

The call went out for volunteers to defend the firesides of the Old Do minion. Appomattox County responded nobly. A Cavalry Company was formed under the command of Capt. Joel W. Flood, becoming Co. H of the 2nd Va. Cavalry. A Company of Heavy Artillery was formed under Capt. James Robertson. A Company of Infantry under Capt. Thos. P. Mat thews, and another Company was formed under Capt. Wm. H. Abbitt, and quite a number of Appomattox citizens living near the rim of the county joined companies from adjoining coun ties. With hearts aflame and bodies dedicated to the Cause they held dear, they went to the front and shared the destiny of the heroes in Gray. Weakened by casualties, new calls came for volunteers, and long after the war, there was a scarcity of able bodied men in the County. Then came April 9, 1865, and the hand of destiny wrote finis across the scroll of four mighty years of struggle Destiny selected Appomattox for one of the major events oi history. Today there is hardly a town- or village in America, that has not heard of Appomattox. Thus ended in this Coun ty, one of the greatest Civil Wars ever chronicled in the files of Time, and at Appomattox began a new page in the history of America. Military rule was established shortly after April 9, 1865. Al county officers were replaced by military appointees. These were men who were selected upon the recommendation of the incumbents, and were willing to take the Iron Clad Oath. In the fall of 1866, an election was held under the Under wood Constitution, which put into effect the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and a new slate of officers were named. Geo. T. Peers became Clerk Wm. T. Johnson Sheriff W. J. Collins, Commissioner of the Revenue the Office of County Treasurer was created Supervisors were provided for, and the ounty Government, practically as we have it now was estab lished. The ravages of four years of war were apparent, and Ap pomattox along with her sister counties, began to repair the wounds. The following years called forth the character and ability of her people, and the present institutions of our Coun- -y are but a tribute to their untiring labor and foresight. From 1870 to the present has been a period of rebuilding and achievement. From its creation the County has been served until now by the following Officers CIRCUIT JUDGESJudges G. A. Wingfield, J. D. Hors- rv, Sam Coleman, George J. Hundley, Robt. F. Hutcheson and Joel W. Flood. COUNTY JUDGESLewis Daniel Isbell, Henry T. Par-  rish and David A. Christian. TRIAL JUSTICEST. R. Horseley and L. F.

On Wednesday evening, December 30, the hospitable home of Miss Etta Bloxton was the scene of one of the unique and enjoyable social events of the season, twenty-six invited guests being present W. D.

H. Spencer and Miss Ella Cheatham, M. H. Hunter, Miss Bessie Glover and Miss Mary Rob ertson. The invitations were very appro priately sent out on stocking-snaped cards. The hostess received her guests at the door dressed as Miss Sant-a Clause, who looked quite bewitching in her gray locks and cap. Christmas verses had been printed on four cards, each of which being cut iuto six irregular pieces and distributed among the guests,- the same to be matched so as to read correctly when each groupe of eix had been brought together in proper manner, it was planned that each group sh.onld write a short Christmas story, a prize being offered for the best production. The fol lowing groups Mis Ella Cheat ham, Mss Annie Robertson, Wm. C. Chilton, Wm. Spencer ancf Mies Mittie Dickerson captured the prize, an automatic toy which afforded much amusement. While this merry-making Has go ing on in the parlor, Miss Santa Clause slipped out, returning a few moments later and announced that light refreshments would be served. Proceeding to the dining loom, Christina- candies were found upon the table, which constituted  light refreshments. Before the merry Crowd recovered from the joke, they were ushered into an adjoining roota which contained a  beanifuI and brilliant lighted tree,on which hungj small bright colored, stockings over flowing with goodies and a present for each guest. Dr. Bloxton, of Richmond, a genial brother of the hostess, was present and by his affa bility, contributed much to the pleasures of the evening. Each guest departed declaring Miss Blox ton a complete and most charming success in the role of Miss Santa Claus. And one had only to look into their faces to see the sam- light which shone there not many years ago, after a visit from the type of Santa Claus, who came down the chimney and filled the stockings by the mantel."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["C", "Chilton"], "snippet": "Mss Annie Robertson, Wm. <mark>C</mark>. <mark>Chilton</mark>, Wm.
