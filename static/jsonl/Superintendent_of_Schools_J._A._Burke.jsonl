Based on recent allotments of state funds per teacher unit of 25 pupils, this would cause a decline of over 4,000 in state funds for the next session. Mr. Burke says that the move ment of many families to defense work areas, older boys and girls leaving school to accept jobs, and lack of insistence on school attend ance by too many parents art some of the causes for the drop in school attendance totals.

I can definitely make this statement upon my own personal knowledge because it was my suggestion that the School Board of Appo mattox County increase the sal ary of Professor Crawley, from 1800.00 at which it had re mained for 15 years, to 2,000.00 a year.

We know, because we were there, and Di vision Superintendent J. A. Burke happily took us on a tour of what awaits some 500 elemenetary school pupils come Sept. 6 and the opening of county public schools. Then we had a look-see at Ap pomattox High School, and Carver- Price and got the impression to pass on to our readers, that educa tion is going to be well taken care of in Appomattox County this ses sion. Naturally, major interests rests with the new elementary school at Appomattox. An enrollment of 550 is anticipated at this new school. Hinant-Hinant  Associates, of Lynchburg, were architects and en gineers for the new elementary ppnt. It is a rambling one-story structure, on a sixteen-acre campus. It has sixteen classrooms,, plus li brary, clinic room, principals office, teachers lounge, cafeteria, kitchen, multi-purpose auditorium and re creation room, and a number of stor age and utility rooms and central heating plant. The floors are of the new Terrazed tile, the metal- deck type roof is interspersed with skylights, is insulated and planned to reduce sound. One corridor runs for 813 feet laterally through the building. Over 2,100 books have been moved into the library, from the A. H, i. library. The plant has a effinumicatins system, operated from the pr\u00eefaeipals office. A feature is a unique wash room at the en trance to the cafeteria where dozens of children can wash their hands at the same time before eating. The cafeteria has 25 large tables and 200 chairs, enabling the student body to be fed in three shifts. The cafeteria kitchen is a modern example of com pact service and equipment. The auditorium-recreation room, has 500 chairs, and a huge stage. Included in the items to be added later, is a curtain for the stage. The classroom arrangement is most attractive. The color scheme varies from room to room, depending on location and lighting. The huge campus is being seeded to grass this week. Busses will load and unload at the front entrance. Pupils living in the Town of Appo mattox  may be picked up by busses coming in from the routes."}, "highlight": {"text": {"matched_tokens": ["Superintendent", "J", "A", "Burke", "a"], "snippet": "there, and Di vision <mark>Superintendent</mark> <mark>J</mark>. <mark>A</mark>. <mark>Burke</mark> happily took us on <mark>a</mark> tour of what awaits some 500"}}, "highlights": [{"field": "text", "matched_tokens": ["Superintendent", "J", "A", "Burke", "a"], "snippet": "there, and Di vision <mark>Superintendent</mark> <mark>J</mark>. <mark>A</mark>. <mark>Burke</mark> happily took us on <mark>a</mark> tour of what awaits some 500"}], "text_match": 3470085063259979897, "text_match_info": {"best_field_score": "5527612030976", "best_field_weight": 15, "fields_matched": 1, "num_tokens_dropped": 0, "score": "3470085063259979897", "tokens_matched": 6, "typo_prefix_score": 0}}

Approximately over four jobs each of a non-prodcctive nature were carried  by the boys on an average, totaling 209 in number. Such jobs con sisted of construction and re pair work, a n d also covered improved practices in field crops, orchards, poultry, home ground improvements and gar dening. These supplementary jobs gave each boy a total of 332 hours, a grand total of 18,- 604 hours.

No history of a rural school system of by-gone days is com plete that does not mention the place of the school as a com munity center and the teacher as the leader in the community. Appomattox is no exception. Be cause the school was usually near the center of the communi ty  therefore, in walking dis tance or later driving distance it was used for religious meet ings, especially for Sunday School for those too far to go to churoh, the Grange and other farm organizations. How many people have enjoyed the fellow ship of each other while plann ing and executing box parties, pie suppers, sings, oyster supp ers and bazaars to make money for the school, but at the same time have a little fun along with it. The teachers visit in the home was once a great occasion to teacher, pupil and! parents. Her visit warded off trouble with Johnny as he great to know her as an individual. She could know Johnny better as she saw him in his natural surroundings. After she had spent the night in ihis home she was usually his friend. The teacher was able to introduce new ideas into the home since she usually was one of the most respected individuals of the com munity. She taught Sunday School, played the organ, may be .got up a play or Christmas program at church or school. Unconsciously she was molding opinions. Sometimes she capti vated the heart of a young swain who saw to it that she remained in the community where she reared a family and in turn be came .a patron yes, a better patron than some she had had.

In 1870, this in novation met with considerable op position. Good judgment finally prevaield and the County Public School System was begun on a very modest scale. The first public school in this county was located in a log cabin near the Old Court House. The first teacher in the public school system was J. H. Featherston. The first County Superintendent of Schools was C. H. Chilton, 1870- 1881. He was succeeded by J. B. Bristow, who continued in office un til 1885. Mr. Chilton returned to office in that year and served until 1897. Sucessors in office were J. K. Hannah, 1897-1913 N. R. Feather ston, 1913-1926 and J. A. Burke, 1926 to date, The first public school house built with county funds was erected at Hurtsville. Other school structures were added as fast as funds from school taxes made these accomoda tions possible. Mr. N. R. Featherston, in his his tory of Appomattox County, re ports that the school term in the early days of the system was five months. Teachers average monthly salary was 25.00. In 1908, Professor Lindsay Craw ley was apointed principal of the high school at Appomattox. The frame building housing the high school stood on the lot where the present T. W. Moses residence is located. There were three teachers and 160. students. Funds allocated by the legislature in this year, with matching donations by private citi zens, financed the building of a new high school at the present site. Appomattox High School open ed in September, 1909, with the im posing name of Tenth Congression al District High School. Our public school system has made great advances in the years since 1909. In the past ten years alone, we have seen the construc tion of a new and up-to-date agri cultural vocational building at the high school addition of a hew gym nasium construction of the Carver- Price High School and elementary school for Negroes, and the build ing of the new elementary school in the town of Appomattox.

Fratrick, Chairman, presided over the meeting and all board members were in attendance along with Eugene Peyton, then acting superintendent, general supervisor Frank Chuchek and Garland Gay of Lynchburg,ar chitect with Garland Gay And Associates. Gay reported to the board that all basic groundwork had been completed on the site of the new high school, all bulk grad ing was completed with storm d r a i n s installed and s o me stonework complete. The necessity of having an owner protective insurance po- licty for the buidling was dis cussed. Although the builder, J. E. Jamerson  Sons, Inc.,carry heavy insurance there will be occasions when the school board would employ workers on the site. R. H. Gray made a motion that the board acquire protect ive insurance and Ruth Webb made a motion that J.A. Burke and Company, the schools lo cal insurance agent write up the policy. The motions carried and the board will go on the advice of council as to the amount of coverage needed. T. E. Pittman, Resident En gineer for the Virginia Highway Department, appeared b e f o r e the board requesting that they pass a resolution approving the construction of an underpass at the railway crossing in Pamp- lin. Peyton reported to the board that school busses crossed over the railway 22 times a day with busses carrying an average of fifty children. R. If. Gray went on record as being strongly in favor of the underpass. The board voted to endorse the und erpass. Pittman explained that the cost for the underpass would be paid by the highway depart ment and the railroad with no cost to the county.
