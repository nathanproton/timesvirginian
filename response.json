                "text": "Yesterday was the 100th a n n i versary of the establishment of a U. iS. Post Office at what is bow Appo mattox, Virginia. Information secured from Nation al Archives and the Post Office De partment, Washington, D. C., tells an interesting story of a full cen tury of mail service here. There have been 20 postmaster andor acting postmaster ap pointments in the 100 years of operation and the incumbent, E. LeRoy Smith, has served longer than any other. The name of the office has been changed several times. On February 23, 1855, a fourth class post office was established here and was call ed Nebraska, Virginia. The first postmaster was Samuel D. McDear- mon. Salary amounted to 6.01. The office operated under the name of Nebraska, Virginia until September 21, 1894, when it was changed to Appomattox. However, due to confusion with the Old Ap pomattox Court House community, the ñamé of the post office here changed on January 15, 189 to West Appomattox, Virginia. It oper ated under that name until June 27, 1906, when it took the present name of Appomattox, Virginia. The office became third class in 1909 and second class in 1987. In mid-1955 it is scheduled to become first class, due to volume of busi ness. Several years ago it became first class, but reverted to second class due to a shift in parcel post business. The following is a list of post masters and their terms Samuel D. MeDearmon, February 23, 1855 Richard H, Mavin, December 31. 1855 Robert I, Boaz, October 4, 1866 Thomas E. Walton, December 22 1867k D- Hix, April 20, 1869 Willbfo l CoIKntf April 1 , i860 Mrs. Mary J. Atwood, February 10, 1666.  Ada A. Landrum, June 26, 1866 N. H. Gregory, October 30, 1867 Miss Elizftbéth H. Dee, Jániury 21, 188 Rufus Furdum, January 1, 1873 Samuel H. Coleman, July 26, 1889 John S. Plunkett, May 9, 1898 Robert Irby, May 7, 1897 Leslie F. Ferguson, May 20, 1918 Robert Irby, April 28, 1922 Lula G. Irby, Acting Postmaster. Ap ril 21, 921 Alfred R. Harwood, Acting Poet- master, May 15, 7931 Joseph E. Dinwiddle, June 1, 1982 E. LeRoy Smith, Acting Poet- master, June 1, 1034 Regular Appointment, March 8, 1936. However, this was not the first pqst. office in what is now Appomat tox County, Tie following inform ation  supplied by the National Archives and reports of the Post Office Department Appomattox County, Virginia The records show that this office was established on April 1, 1811, under the name of Floods, Buckings ham County, Virginia, with Thomas Trent the first postmaster. It is shown that the name oi the county was changed to Prince Edward on March 22, 1837, that the name of the office was changed to Clover Hill on July 7, 1837 and that the county in which the office was lo cated was changed to Appomattox sometime between September 23, 1845 and June 30, 1849. The re cords show that the name of the office was changed to Appomattox Court House on February 3, 1859 and changed to Appomattox on July 3, 1892.  It therefore appears that the his tory of a post office at what is now without a post office but known as Old Appomattox Court House, is equally interesting. That part of the county was in Buckingham when the post office was established as Floods in 1811. Later it became a part of Prince Edward and finally Appo mattox in 1845. Shortly after the burning of the court house in 1892, the court house was rebuilt at what is now the Town of Appomattox, and final ly the post office at the historic old village was discontinued. It was of ficially Appomattox Court House, Virginia, at the time Gen. Lee sur rendered to Gen. Grant.
